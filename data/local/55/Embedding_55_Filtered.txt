In this experiment, the liquid flow rate was varied, and the mass transfer of the microreactor was investigated. The gas flow rate was held at 0.05 sccm, while the flow rate of feeding solution ranged from 10 μL/min to 80 μL/min. The concentration of nitrobenzene at the inlet was maintained at 50 mM. Fig. 8 shows that the conversion of ni- trobenzene and the product concentration decreased with increasing

The gaseous reactant was high-purity hydrogen, and it had an im- portant eﬀect on the conversion of nitrobenzene and the aniline pro- duct. In this experiment, the liquid flow rate was maintained at 10 μL/ min, and the inlet nitrobenzene concentration was kept at 50 mM. The only variable was the gas flow rate, which was varied from 0.01 sccm to 0.05 sccm. As shown in Fig. 9, when the initial gas flow rate was 0.01 sccm, the conversion of nitrobenzene was only 9.7%. As the gas flow rate increased, the conversion continuously increased. When the gas flow rate was increased to 0.05 sccm, the conversion of nitrobenzene and the aniline concentration were 91% and 45.5 mM, respectively. These results show that the performance of the microreactor was im- proved by more hydrogen, which can be explained by the following reasons. Increasing the gas flow rate increased the hydrogen pressure in the HFM and caused hydrogen concentration at the catalyst layer to be increased, which increased the reaction rate. An insuﬃcient hydrogen concentration may allow the liquid feed solution to compress the gas reactant. Correspondingly, there would be less gas available for the reaction. Increasing the gas flow rate increased the pressure, which was dramatically improved by the satisfactory permeability of the HFM. More hydrogen at the catalyst layer produced more aniline. At a given liquid flow rate, the increase in the gas flow rate increased both the conversion and product concentration. These results indicate that a relatively higher gas flow rate is required for a better performance of

the liquid flow rate. For a given gas flow rate, the reaction initially resulted in a conversion of more than 93% at a relatively low liquid flow rate. Hence, it can be speculated that the supplied hydrogen re- acted completely with the nitrobenzene solution. With an increases in the liquid flow rate, the residence time gradually decreased. Hence, the eﬀective reaction time of nitrobenzene was also reduced when the flow rate was increased to 80 μL/min. Too high liquid flow rate directly resulted in partial discharge of the nitrobenzene fed from the mem- brane microreactor without reaction, and the product aniline was di- luted by the increased volume of feed solution. On the other hand, the increase of the liquid flow rate increased the pressure in the capillary, and because the pressure on the gas side remained the same, the gas compartment was compressed by the liquid compartment. Therefore, the hydrogen concentration of the catalyst layer was gradually reduced, and the mass transport resistance of hydrogen increased. Both the re- action rate and time decreased such that the conversion of nitrobenzene and the aniline concentration clearly decreased. In summary, the liquid flow rate can greatly aﬀect the reaction rate and time. With increasing the liquid flow rate, the nitrobenzene conversion and aniline con- centration decrease.

microreactor. Some of the critical parameters (i.e., PDA film, gas flow rate, liquid flow rate and inlet nitrobenzene concentration) of the hollow fiber catalytic membrane microreactor were investigated to optimize the microreactor design. The feasibility of this design will be useful for the development of membrane microreactors.

2.3. Fabrication of the tube-in-tube hollow fiber catalytic membrane microreactor

3.2. Performance evaluation of tube-in-tube hollow fiber catalytic membrane microreactor

• A tube-in-tube hollow fiber catalytic membrane microreactor was developed. • Hollow fiber catalytic membrane was formed by the layer-by-layer self-assembly method. • The developed catalytic membrane showed good activity and mass transfer eﬃciency. • Good performance and stability were achieved by the developed membrane microreactor.

In this work, a novel hollow fiber catalytic membrane microreactor was successfully developed for a G-L-S reaction system using a tube-in- tube structure and LBL self-assembly. The catalytic reaction of ni- trobenzene with hydrogen was used to evaluate the performance of the catalytic membrane microreactor. The tube-in-tube hollow fiber mod- ules provided two diﬀerent passages that allowed the liquid reactant to flow through the external PTFE capillary and the gas to flow through the microchannel supplied by the hollow fiber. The HFM module was modified with PDA and polyelectrolyte films. A Pd nanocatalyst layer was finally grafted on the HFM by LBL self-assembly. Because the hollow fiber had significant permeability to gas, hydrogen readily pe- netrated the membrane and reacted on the catalyst layer. Based on the surface topography and elemental analysis, it can be concluded that the catalytic nanoparticles were successfully deposited and well distributed on the HFM. Varying the reactor parameters revealed the eﬀects of diﬀerent modifications, the liquid flow rate, the gas flow rate and the inlet nitrobenzene concentration on the reactor performance. The mi- croreactor performed well in a long-term test that lasted 30 h due to its unique structure and the modification of the HFM. A PDA film im- proved the stability of the reaction. Increasing the gas flow rate or decreasing the liquid flow rate increased the aniline concentration and nitrobenzene conversion. At given liquid and gas flow rates, the inlet nitrobenzene concentration was the key component aﬀecting the re- actor performance. Due to the limited catalytic ability of the reactor, not all the nitrobenzene was converted to aniline. A higher supplied nitrobenzene concentration corresponded to a higher aniline product concentration and a lower nitrobenzene conversion. The obtained re- sults demonstrate that our catalytic membrane microreactor is useful for G-L-S reactions. Especially for those hydrogenation reactions and catalytic reduction, good performance can also be achieved due to the oﬀered advantages, such as a high specific surface area and controllable catalytic interface. This new catalytic membrane microreactor design open a new window for the development of multiphase catalytic reac- tion systems.

The miniaturization of membrane reactors aims to improve the mass transfer eﬃciency. A tube-in-tube hollow fiber catalytic membrane microreactor that contains dual characteristics of a catalytic membrane reactor and a microreactor was developed in this study. For a gas-liquid-solid (G-L-S) reactor, the immobilization of solid catalysts on a hollow fiber membrane (HFM) via layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly enables the model reaction of nitrobenzene hydrogenation to occur. The unique structure of the novel catalytic membrane microreactor se- parates the gas and liquid reactants and shortens the transfer distance. The experimental results showed that the nitrobenzene conversion was high during 30 h of continuous operation. The eﬀects of the flow rates and inlet nitrobenzene concentration were also investigated. At a given gas flow rate, the nitrobenzene conversion and concentration of the product aniline decreased with increasing the liquid flow rate. Meanwhile, at a given liquid flow rate, an increase in the gas flow rate led to an increase in the pressure of the gas phase. Suﬃcient hydrogen promoted the reaction, increasing the nitrobenzene conversion and aniline concentration. In addition, the inlet nitrobenzene concentration aﬀected the conversion. Higher concentration not only enhanced the reaction rate but also caused catalyst poisoning. Based on these results, the newly designed catalytic membrane microreactor is feasible to improve the performance towards multiphase reaction.

The tube-in-tube hollow fiber catalytic membrane microreactor contained an internal hollow fiber catalytic membrane and external PTFE capillary tube. To permit the gaseous and liquid streams to flow into the membrane microreactor at the same time, an autonomous connector with two exits made by a syringe needle was adopted in the experiment. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the catalyst coated HFM was placed into a PTFE capillary. At the entrance of the tube, there was a specia- lized needle connected to the both the capillary tube and hollow fiber. Every capillary tube in this study included only one hollow fiber that allowed for gas flow. The middle interval between the hollow fiber and capillary tube was the passageway for the liquid reactant. The micro- channel for gas flow had a volume of 48 μL, a length of 50 cm and a diameter of 350 μm. The external microchannel for the liquid reactant had a volume of 474.9 μL, an outer diameter of 1 mm, an inner diameter of 450 μm and a length of 50 cm.

In this experiment, the inlet nitrobenzene concentration was varied, and the nitrobenzene conversion and aniline concentration were in- vestigated. The gas and liquid flow rates were kept at 0.05 sccm and 10 μL/min, respectively. The nitrobenzene concentration at the inlet was 30, 50, 70, 90 or 110 mM. Fig. 10 shows the variations of the ni- trobenzene conversion and aniline concentration with the inlet ni- trobenzene concentration under the same gas and liquid flow rates. As the nitrobenzene concentration increased, the conversion decreased, while the aniline concentration increased. Increasing the nitrobenzene concentration decreased the nitrobenzene conversion from 93% to 70%, but increased the aniline concentration from 27.9 mM to 77 mM. The reasons leading to these phenomena can be described as follows. The increased inlet nitrobenzene conversion could enhance the cata- lytic reaction, which would also produce more aniline. However, the catalytic capacity of the microreactor was limited. The high con- centration of nitrobenzene in solution could more easily lead to catalyst poisoning, which would generate more byproducts such as nitrotoluene and nitrosobenzene. Thereby, the nitrobenzene conversion would de- crease with the increasing nitrobenzene concentration. Based on these results, it can be concluded that a low inlet nitrobenzene concentration benefitted the product concentration but not the nitrobenzene conver- sion. However, the nitrobenzene conversion was maintained at a higher

In this work, the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene catalyzed by Pd nanocatalyst served as a model reaction for examining the performance of the developed membrane microreactor. This reaction is attractive because it does not proceed in the absence of catalyst and it produces fewer byproducts. During the operation, high-purity hydrogen was fed into the interior of the modified hollow fiber while a freshly prepared aqueous ethanol solution containing 30 mM nitrobenzene flowed through the external capillary tube. After the reaction was stable, the samples were collected at the exit every 1 h. According to the above description, a complete catalyst layer coated on the membrane micro- reactor consisted of a PDA film, PEM film and nanocatalyst Pd. To evaluate the influence of each step, multiple tube-in-tube hollow fiber catalytic membrane microreactors with the same structure and size were fabricated. In all of these tests, the experimental conditions were the same. The hydrogen and nitrobenzene flow rates were 0.05 sccm and 10 μL/min, respectively.

level and did not dramatically decrease at an inlet nitrobenzene con- centration of 110 mM, which illustrates the excellent performance of our catalytic membrane microreactor.

The catalytic performance of the developed tube-in-tube HFM mi- croreactor was evaluated by a G-L-S (three-phase) model reaction, the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene on palladium nanoparticles. Fig. 2 shows a diagram of the experimental system. Nitrobenzene was dis- solved in ethanol:water (7:3 by volume) and supplied as the liquid re- actant, which was pumped into the PTFE capillary using a syringe pump (Longer, China). Hydrogen was fed into the HFM, and the flow rate was controlled by a mass flow meter (Omega, USA). The reaction was conducted at room temperature. The reactant nitrobenzene and the desired product aniline were contained in the liquid phase and collected at the outlet. The concentrations of these compounds were measured by a gas chromatograph (7890B, Agilent, USA) equipped with a flame

research. Narrowing the spaces on both sides of the membrane can shorten the transfer distance and improve the catalytic reaction rate. From this point of view, the miniaturization of membrane reactors is a promising way to improve their performances. Among the numerous membrane materials, hollow fiber modules might be the most compact configuration with a very high packing density and a diameter of a few millimeters. Unlike other membranes, the specific surface area of a hollow fiber is very high and can reach 30,000 m2/m3. Therefore, a hollow fiber membrane (HFM) can be considered as a microchannel with a high specific surface area and a short diﬀusion path [6] and is able to separate and infiltrate diﬀerent phases [7,8]. In addition, hollow fiber substrates possess several ad- vantages for fabricating membrane microreactors, such as easy scale-up and catalyst loading [9,10]. In this case, metal nanoparticles are un- iquely superior catalysts with a high surface area-to-volume ratio can be easily immobilized on hollow fiber membranes. Metal nanoparticles are typically prepared by impregnation, in-situ reduction or chemical vapor deposition [11,12]. However, the particles prepared using these methods are frequently non-uniform and easily leached. To cope with these issues, the layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly deposition of poly- cations and polyanions ensures that catalytic nanoparticles are im- mobilized on HFMs. The selective adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes provides a simply way to deposit a controllable support film for metal nanoparticles. In 1942, Decher [13] first came up with this versatile method that enabled the construction of functional mul- tilayer films. The electrostatic attraction between the polyelectrolyte components is the principal driving force of the LBL self-assembly, but covalent bonding [14], hydrogen bonding [15], hydrophobic interac- tions [16] and charge transfer [17] are also associative interactions. Kidambi et al. [18] investigated the LBL deposition of a polyelectrolyte on alumina and the subsequent reduction of Pd2+ as a versatile method for synthesizing immobilized Pd nanocatalysts. Kaner et al. [19] suc- cessfully modified a commercial polyethersulfone membrane by an LBL self-assembly method to prevent extensive organic and biological fouling and improve water permeability. Ouyang et al. [20] in- vestigated metal nanoparticles immobilized on HFMs via a polyelec- trolyte and negatively charged Au nanoparticles. Macanas et al. [21] prepared polymer-stabilized metal nanoparticles in a functionalized polymeric membrane by polyelectrolyte deposition. These studies have paved the way for manufacturing an eﬃcient catalyst layer by adhering polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs). Although numerous studies have been carried out, the chemical performance and stability of hollow fi- bers is unsatisfied. Dopamine exhibits very robust and strong adhesion, acting as a multifunctional material to increase stability [22–24]. In this study, a polydopamine (PDA) film was coated on a hollow fiber prior to introducing the PEMs. A literature review indicated that the catechol group in dopamine can adhere to many types of surfaces because of its mussel-mimicking versatility. PEMs can deposit on a HFM via hydro- phobic interactions [25]. The PDA pretreatment make the HFM more stable for the catalyst loading because of the above characteristics. This paper describes an autonomous tube-in-tube hollow fiber cat- alytic membrane microreactor consisting of a modified HFM and a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) capillary with the aim of improving the mass transfer and reaction rate. The tube-in-tube design provides a large contact area between gas and liquid reactants and a region for catalyst loading. Coating the HFM with a catalyst layer enables the miniaturization of the membrane reactor, and this structure combines the merits of membrane and microreactor technologies. Thus, a novel device with a large surface-area-to-volume ratio, short transfer dis- tance, and excellent flexibility was created. All of these characteristics are especially profitable for gas-liquid-solid (G-L-S) catalytic reactions. This work took advantage of the device to investigate the performance of the reaction about hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. A catalyst layer of Pd nanoparticles was coated on a single hollow fiber, which was modified by LBL self-assembly. An additional layer of PDA film can eﬀectively improve the stability of the catalytic membrane

with the PDA coating. Subsequently, a polycationic solution containing 0.02 M PAH and 0.5 M NaCl was pumped into the module at a flow rate of 40 μL/min for 1 h, followed by rinsing with deionized water at the same flow rate for 0.5 h. Hence, the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes were deposited on the fiber through electrostatic interactions. This polyelectrolyte deposition process was repeated 4 times to obtain abundant charge carriers, which improve the catalyst loading. Next, a palladium chloride solution was prepared in HCl (10 mM) and injected via syringe into the module at a flow rate of 10 μL/min for 3 h. For palladium reduction, a dilute aqueous NaBH4 solution (10 mM) passed through the fiber for 2 h at a flow rate of 10 μL/min in an ice bath. The module was washed with deionized water and dried under nitrogen environment. The hollow fiber catalytic membrane was extracted from the capillary tube for fabrication of the membrane microreactor. In consideration of this fabrication, the catalyst layer on the HFM was prepared with three coatings: a PDA film, PEM and reduced palladium catalytic membrane.

reactors in multiphase reactions has been very popular and received considerable attention. Typically, a membrane reactor for a three-phase catalytic reaction allows liquid and gas streams to contact each other via a membrane with a catalyst deposited on its surface. The liquid and gas reactants have to diﬀuse to the catalytic surface in order to react with each other. Diﬀusion, as the main transfer mode in membrane reactors, has a significant eﬀect on the reaction rate. Shortening the transfer paths of diﬀerent reactants is beneficial for the diﬀusion and improving the reaction rates. Therefore, ways to provide a shorter transfer path and improve the reaction rate are important areas of

In this study, the hollow fiber catalytic membrane was formed by coating the hollow fiber with a palladium nanoparticle catalyst layer. The preparation of the catalyst layer on the hollow fiber was realized by the LBL self-assembly method. The HFM was built in a capillary tube in order to achieve the modifications. The modification process generally involves directly immersing the hollow fibers in polyelectrolyte solu- tions. However, the extent of conversion and time required were un- satisfactory. In this work, hence, dopamine was first deposited on the surface of the hollow fiber to form a PDA film as an adhesive for polyelectrolyte solutions that would previously pass through the fiber. PDA has many significant advantages, especially its adhesive property. PDA can bind hollow fibers together in a manner similar to the adhesive action of mussels. Additionally, PDA is zwitterionic due to its diverse functional groups such as catechol and amino groups. Below pH = 4, the amino groups are protonated, and the dopamine surface carries positive charges [25]. To do this, the hollow fiber was first rinsed with deionized water for 30 min to remove impurities. Then, an aqueous dopamine solution was passed through the fiber, and a PDA coating was formed on the fiber surface. The aqueous dopamine solution composed of 2 mg of dopamine per milliliter and 10 mM tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane was pumped into the HFM at a flow rate of 20 μL/min for 6 h. Then, the solution was removed from the module by rinsing with deionized water and drying at 65 °C for 1 h under nitrogen en- vironment. The dopamine self-polymerization formed a PDA film ad- hered to the hollow fiber, and the color of the hollow fiber changed from white to brown. After the deposition of the PDA film, the PEMs were prepared by alternating adsorption of polycations and polyanions. First, a dilute aqueous containing 0.02 M PSS and 0.5 M NaCl solution was fed into the module at a flow rate of 40 μL/min for 1 h, followed by rinsing with deionized water at the same flow rate for 0.5 h to remove excess polyelectrolytes. As mentioned above, the amino groups of PDA will be protonated below pH = 4. Therefore, the PSS solution was ad- justed to pH 3.5 using NaOH or HCl to allow the polyanion to combine
