To increase the reactor output, one of the commonly used approaches is to scale up the reactor capacity that is the reactor channel diameter in continuous flow microreactors. However, dur- ing the scaling-up of microreactors their unique characteristics need to be kept, such as microfluidic controllability, and mass and heat transfer properties. To understand the scalability of the droplet-base microreactor for the nitration reaction in this work, microreactors with three microchannel diameters (i.e. 0.5, 1.0 and 1.59 mm i.d.) were constructed to investigate the effect of varying reactor channel diameter on reactant conversion with a fixed N/S at 0.57, M-ratio at 1.6, and temperature at 298 K (Fig. 8). As can be seen from Fig. 8(a), where both residence time (t = 333.5 s) and total flow rate (Q = 142 lL�min�1) were kept con- stant by changing the reactor length (0.4–4 m) accordingly, the conversion of etherate decreased slightly from 80% to 75.5% with the increase of the inner diameter of the reactor tube from 0.5 mm to 1.59 mm. That was mainly due to the change of flow dynamics. As the residence time and the total flow rate were kept unchanged, the smaller inner diameter resulted in higher flow velocity, leading to more intense chaotic convection and more rapid interface renewal that were beneficial to the apparent reac- tion rate. In addition, the increase of inner diameter was more favorable for the occurrence of coalescence of the dispersed dro- plets, which further reduced the liquid–liquid two-phase interfa- cial area and increased the mass transfer distance.

3.2.3. Effects of varying total flow rate With a given diameter of the reaction tube, varying total volu- metric flow rate can affect the liquid–liquid two-phase hydrody- namics in the droplet-based reactor that may have potential impact on the reaction performance. This possible effect was examined by varying the total flow rate in a range of 200–1200 l L�min�1. Accordingly, the main reaction tube length was changed in order to keep a constant residence time (83 s), while remaining N/S, M-ratio, organic phase concentration and reaction tempera- ture all as constant. The reactant conversion and product selectiv- ity as a function of total flow rate are depicted in Fig. 5. It was observed that the conversion increased slightly from 65% to 67% with the increase of the total flow rate in the low total flow rate range (<426 lL�min�1). That was followed by a slight decrease in conversion from 67% to 61% when the total flow rate was increased from 426 lL�min�1 to 580 lL�min�1. As the total flow rate was raised further from 580 lL�min�1 to 1200 lL�min�1, a very slight recovery of conversion was found, from 61% to 64%.

The microreactor consisted mainly of a FEP T-mixer (i.d. 0.5 mm, IDEX Health & Science), two inlet PTFE tubes with suffi- cient length for preheating (i.d. 0.5 mm, length 1 m, IDEX Health & Science), and a main reaction circular PTFE channel with selected inner diameter and length (i.d. 0.5, 1.0, or 1.59 mm; length 0.4– 8 m; Nichias Corporation). The microreactor and overall experi- mental setup is schematically shown in Fig. 1. Two precision syringe pumps (Harvard 11 ELITE Single, USA) were used to deliver organic phase and the mixed acid through the respective inlet tube into the T-mixer, and then the main reac- tion channel. All inlet tubes, T-mixer and the reaction channel were placed in a thermostatic water bath (Julabo GmnH CORIO CD-200F, Germany) at preset reaction temperature. The residence time was regulated by the length of the reaction channel and/or flow rate. The M-ratio was controlled by the volumetric flow rate ratio of two phases. The reaction mixture from the outlet of the main reac- tion channel was then quenched in an ice-water bath (Julabo GmnH CORIO CD-200F, Germany). The organic phase was sepa- rated quickly from the quenched reaction mixture, and was subse- quently treated with solvent removal by natural volatilization at room temperature, drying by a baking oven at 333 K, powder grinding to form final fine powder product. A stereo microscope (Olympuss ZX2-ILLK, Japan) coupled with a high-speed camera (Phantom Miro R311, USA) were used to record the droplet length and flow. The imaging frame rates was set as 1000 frames per sec- ond. The length and the distance of the acid droplets were mea- sured by ImageJ.

In the conventional batch process, the reaction temperature range of 273–278 K is generally selected while the mixed acid has to be added dropwise into the reactor over a lengthy period of feeding time, typically 2–4 h, that is followed by a further >5 h reaction time to complete the reaction (Jiang, 2006). Clearly, these constrains have impact significantly on the space time yield of the reactor and the efficiency of the overall process. Despite the importance of this product commercially and agriculturally, the fundamental drawbacks of macroscale batch reactors together with the remarkable lack of kinetics data for this particular reac- tion still hinder the progress for improving the process towards economically viable and environmentally sustainable manufacturing. The aim of the present research was to develop a continuous flow process for aromatic nitration with mixed acid towards the production of acifluorfen, while gain insights into the chemical kinetics of the reaction, by using droplet-based microreactor tech- nology that has been intensively developed in our previous work. Through selected design of the droplet-based microreactor, the nitration of 3-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy] benzoic acid with mixed (HNO3/H2SO4) acid was carried out in the continuous flow droplet format. The reaction conditions were optimized by quantifying the effects of a wide range of key operating parame- ters, including reaction temperature, residence time and total flow rate, molar ratio of HNO3 to H2SO4 (namely, N/S), molar ratio of HNO3 to 3-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy] benzoic acid (namely, M-ratio), and the introduction of acetic anhydride into organic phase (mainly 1,2-dichloroethane) as a solubility promoter and also water absorbent. Three microreactor dimensions were also designed in order to assess the microreactor scalability. Fur-

The variation of reactant conversion was likely a result of the effect of total flow rate on the flow dynamic behavior of droplet- based microfluidics, such as geometry of dispersed droplets, their possible coalescence along the microchannel and two-phase inter- facial property (Hao et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2013). Generally, at high total flow rates smaller dispersed droplets are formed that increased the interfacial surface area and, in turn, enhanced mass transfer performance leading to higher reaction rates. On the other hand, higher total flow rates can cause the coalescence of the dis- persed acid droplets in microchannels, which can weaken the mass transfer performance. As observed in Fig. 6, the dispersion of the two-phase droplets was uniform and stable when the flow rate was below 426 lL�min�1. In that case, the internal circulation in the droplets and the renewal velocity of two-phase phase interface were enhanced with the increase in the total flow rate, where the mass transfer rate from the organic phase to the acid droplets was intensified (Zhao et al., 2007; Antony et al., 2014), resulting in higher conversions. It can be seen in Fig. 6, with further increase in the flow rate, the coalescence of the dispersed droplets occurred causing the decrease of two-phase interfacial area and reduced mass transfer performance, despite the possible chaotic flow of the continuous phase at high flow rates (Husny and Cooper- White, 2006). As shown in Fig. 5, the selectivity of the nitration reaction under these operating conditions remained approximately constant. This was largely due to the residence time, N/S, M-ratio, organic phase concentration and reaction temperature all being kept unchanged, which were considered to be the main factors affecting the selec- tivity of this reaction. Overall, the effect of total flow rate was insignificant on either conversion or selectivity under the experiment conditions, sug- gesting a very wide operating zone which is beneficial for optimiz- ing operation conditions and process scaling-up.

The submillimeter microscale continuous flow process is particu- larly of significance to fast exothermic and complex reactions, such as polymerization and radical reactions involving unstable inter- mediates or toxic reagents (Kim et al., 2004; Zaborenko et al., 2010). In our series of studies on microreactor technology, we have successfully developed a range of droplet-based microreactors, demonstrating the capability and suitability for effective multi- phase reactions by regulating hydrodynamics, interface character- istics and overall mass transfer (Zhang et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020; Hao et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2021). Furthermore, microreactors have been shown as a promising plat- form for the characterization of chemical reaction kinetics, mainly due to the high degree of controllability over the multiphase microenvironment (Zaborenko et al., 2010; McMullen and Jensen, 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Su et al., 2015). With the unique characteristics of microreactors, the perfor- mance of high space time yield, short reaction time, low energy consumption, and high selectivity have also been demonstrated for carrying out aromatic nitration (Olah et al., 1989; Jähnisch et al., 2004; Coyle and Oelgemöller, 2008; Illg et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2015). By using a continuous-mode microreactor, Kulkarni et al. (Kulkarni et al., 2009) realized the nitration of ben- zaldehyde with controllable reaction time, temperature and stoi- chiometric ratios. Yu et al. (Yu et al., 2013) developed a continuous microreactor process for the nitration of p-difluorobenzene with fuming nitric acid achieving a high product yield 98% within 2 min reaction time. Lan et al. (Lan and Lu, 2021) further developed a micropacked-bed reactor for the continuous nitration of o-dichlorobenzene which was impressively completed within 5 s with a selectivity of 89% for the main product. Consider- ing the highly exothermic nature with high risk of explosion, the nitration reaction is normally performed at low temperature, typ- ically around 273 K, which can inevitably increase operating diffi- culties and energy consumption. To address these issues, Wen et al.

(2) The effect of total flow rate was insignificant on either con- version (varying between 61% and 67%) or selectivity (vary- ing between 80% and 81%) under the experiment conditions, suggesting a very wide operating zone which is beneficial for optimizing operation conditions and process scaling-up. (3) The results from three reactor channel geometries (i.d. 0.5, 1.0 and 1.59 mm) were indicative that, under the given experimental conditions, with a slight decrease in reactant conversion (from 80% to 70%) it was able to give a fourfold increase in total volumetric flow rate when the reactor chan- nel diameter was doubled (from 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm). (4) The addition of acetic anhydride content can improve the solubility of etherate in the organic phase (mainly 1,2- dichloroethane) and the absorbability of water produced from the reaction, to inhibit the decrease of sulfuric acid strength while promote the generation of NO2 +, leading to increase in conversion. With the increase of acetic anhydride content, however, the dinitration products increase accord- ingly, resulting in the reduction of the product selectivity. (5) Pseudo-homogeneous based kinetics models have been developed of apparent reaction rate constant and intrinsic reaction rate constant for the reaction of 3-[2-chloro-4- (trifluoromethyl) phenoxy] benzoic acid with nitronium ion. Excellent linear relations are obtained and the apparent reaction rate is in compliance with the second-order reac- tion assumption, at given four temperature levels (i.e. 288, 298, 308 and 318 K) with four mixed acid compositions (concentration of sulfuric acid: 11.3, 12.09, 12.42 and 13.53 mol�L�1). The values of A and Ea in the Arrhenius equa- tion for this reaction are determined to be 3.75 � 104 m3/(- mol�s) and 37.9 kJ�mol�1, respectively. The calculated results based on the kinetics model are in good agreement with the experimental results.

MA denotes the relative molecular mass of etherate, and qOrganic, the density of etherate. w is the mass fraction of etherate in organic phase. To determine the apparent reaction rate constant kapp, in this work the kinetic experiments were conducted at four temperature levels (i.e. 288, 298, 308 and 318 K) with four compositions of mixed acid where the sulfuric acid concentration were 11.30, 12.09, 12.42 and 13.53 mol�L�1. The experiments were carried out at high flow rate, and the total flow rate of organic phase and mixed acid phase was set as 845–3380.7 lL�min�1. The measured parameters (G) as a function of reaction time (t) are plotted in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the excellent linear relations were obtained under the given operating conditions, supporting the assumption of a second-order reaction.

constants, whilst higher mass transfer rates across the two phases. Fig. 3(b) shows that the selectivity decreased with the increase of either reaction temperature or residence time, indicating the pos- sible side reactions which were accelerated at higher temperatures and prolonged over longer reaction times. As generally understood, the reaction rate coefficient increases with the increase of reaction temperature according to the Arrhe- nius equation. At the same time, the increase in temperature can enhance mass transfer across the multiphase interface, as the molecular diffusion coefficient is proportional to the reaction tem- perature, which can further increase the apparent reaction rate. When the residence time of the reagents in the microreactor was short (<300 s), the reaction was unable to complete, thus showed overall low conversions especially in the low temperature range. On the other hand, when a longer residence time was selected, it gave higher possibility of side reactions reducing the selectivity of the main product, as also observed in other reactions (Zeibi Shirejini and Mohammadi, 2017). For a balanced outcome, temper- atures and residence times in the middle ranges (i.e. 298 K and 220 s) were selected in the subsequent investigations into the effects of other factors.

In the present work, the continuous flow nitration reaction of 3- [2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy] benzoic acid with a mix- ture of nitric and sulfuric acid was investigated within droplet- based microreactors. A wide range of operating parameters were examined to quantify their effects on the reaction outcome, includ- ing reaction temperature, residence time, M-ratio, N/S, total flow rate, composition of organic phase, and microreactor tube diame- ter. Furthermore, a pseudo-homogeneous based kinetics model was developed to determine the kinetics parameters of the nitra- tion reaction, and the calculated data was validated against exper- imental results.

was able to give a fourfold increase in total volumetric flow rate when the reactor channel diameter was doubled (from 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm).

(1) Increasing reaction temperature and M-ratio results in over- all higher reaction rate and conversion, and simultaneously increase in side reaction rate leading to the reduction of pro- duct selectivity, while increasing N/S reduces the conversion but has insignificant effect on product selectivity. The opti- mized reaction temperature, M-ratio and N/S are found to be 308 K, 1.6 and 0.57, respectively. Under optimal reaction conditions, a conversion of 83.03% and selectivity of 79.52% have been achieved in a microreactor (i.d. d= 0.5 mm, L = 4 m).

3.2.1. Effects of reaction temperature and residence time For the heterogeneous nitration reaction, the reaction tempera- ture and the residence time are important factors that affect the conversion of the reagents and the selectivity of the main product. Their effects were quantified by varying temperature (288–318 K) and residence time (60–660 s) in the reactor while keeping N/S at 0.57 in the mixed acid and an M-ratio of 1.6. The experimental results are depicted in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the conversion of etherate increased by increasing either residence time or reaction temperature. The former can be attributed to the longer contact time of the two reactant phases and longer reaction time. The latter was mainly due to the higher temperature resulting in higher reaction rate

3.2.2. Effects of M-ratio and N/S in the mixed acid By varying M-ratio (0.9–2.0) and N/S (0.41–0.75) in the mixed acid, their effects on reaction conversion and selectivity were investigated with a fixed temperature of 298 K and a residence time of 220 s. The results are illustrated Fig. 4.

By varying total flow rate and flow rate ratio, stable and control- lable droplet-based multiphase microfluidics was achieved, as shown in Fig. 2. Regular droplets were generated of aqueous phase mixed acid which were suspended in the continuous organic phase composed of mainly 1,2-dichloroethane as main carrier, and reac- tant 3-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy] benzoic acid (or etherate) whose mass fraction in the total mass of two fluid streams was 8.8 wt%. Because the solubility of the reactant in 1,2-dichloroethane is very low, especially as no acetic anhydride exists in the organic phase. In order to stably deliver the feed with- out solid particles, a large amount of solvent must be adopted in microreactor. Although the low content of reactant will reduce the production capacity, it is more important to carry out success- fully the nitration process, control precisely the operating parame- ters and improve the stability of the product quality. Varying amount of acetic anhydride was also added to the organic phase
