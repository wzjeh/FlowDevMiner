and depended on the material and thickness of layer. In case of batch reactor, UV exposed area was 3.14 cm2 and intensity was 4.23 mW cm−2 after passing 1 mm thickness of glass plate. And commercial glass microreactor received same UV intensity, 4.23 mW cm−2 with 0.08 cm2 channel bottom area, meanwhile measured UV intensity of the AHPCS microreactor coated with 100 �m thickness of inorganic polymer was 3.99 mW cm−2. The specific degradation rates of 4-CP in the presence of TiO2 nanoparti- cles per unit photonic energy at various conditions were illustrated with different concentrations and injection flow rates of 4-CP solution. Based on this intensity, effective photonic energy was cal- culated by multiplying UV intensity, exposure area and retention time for each case as listed in Table 1. Generally, AHPCS microreac- tor showed 95% of conversion rate at various flow rates compared with glass microreactor, which is consistent with the similar optical

affected cell membrane and DNAs. In contrast, plain microchan- nel with no TiO2 beads was infused with broth containing E. coli at the same flow rate and then exposed to UV radiation, there was slight sterilization effect of E. coli, which occurred by UV irradia- tion. Eventually, it demonstrated that optically transparent AHPCS derived microchannel was very useful as a photocatalytic microre- actor by decomposition photochemistry and sterilization effect of E. coli. And it is plausible that inorganic polymer based microchan- nel is very useful as a photochemical microreactor with high optical transparency and excellent stability, which cannot be realized in the plastic or polymer derived microreactors.

the fabrication processes including photolithography, etching and bonding of glass or quartz were very expensive, time and labor con- suming, and only surface coated area participated in reaction out of channel owing to its existence of extremely small amount on channel surface. Therefore, we report the feasible chip preparation process and performance evaluation of inorganic polymer derived microreactor having optically transparent, facile fabrication capa- bility by imprinting lithography, as photocatalytic microreactor. We evaluated the photocatalytic performance by comparison with commercial glass microreactor and inorganic derived microreac- tor using Degussa P25, TiO2 nanoparticles as photocatalysts under identical conditions. Furthermore, we prepared packed bed type of microreactor with TiO2 coated beads via sol–gel process and they are packed in microchannel in monolayer to enhance the photonic efficiency. To evaluate the photocatalytic performance of packed bed microreactor, live cell count of Escherichia coli was used as a reporting system for the evaluation of sterilization performance.

transparency of both microreactors. Deviation between glass and AHPCS microreactors is supposedly by the loss of photonic energy that occurred by the scattering of UV at the microchannel. In the range of 4-CP concentration below 2 mM, degradation rates were highly dependent on concentration above 2 mM, it became con- stant at each flow rate, by reaching the saturation stage of injected TiO2 amount. To increase the photocatalytic efficiency, alternative TiO2 packed bed photocatalytic microreactor was prepared by packing TiO2 coated silica bead into the chamber (100 �m of height and 1000 �m of width, and throat barrier of 30 �m width) of AHPCS microchannel for higher capacity and immobilization of photocat- alysts. As shown in Fig. 4(a), 50 �m diameter of silica bead increased to 70–80 �m after coating and turned to opaque owing to TiO2 shell. In addition, TiO2 nanoparticles in the range 300–500 nm were crystallized on the surface of the beads. For identification of TiO2 species for photocatalytic activity, a rutile and an anatase TiO2 were confirmed by XRD (Fig. 4(b)) [11]. Because microbeads were packed in monolayer in microchan- nel, facile flow with low pressure drop were generated, and microbeads were captured by mouth–throat structure at the end of micro channel as shown in Fig. 4(c). As a photocatalytic per- formance indicator, E. coli was prepared. When E. coli broth was injected into TiO2 packed bed photocatalytic microreactor showed sterilization effect by decreasing the numbers of live E. coli to 110 from 9500 in 4.2 �l/min of flow rate, which was verified by 24 h incubation on a nutrient agar plate with eluted sample from microreactor as shown in Fig. 5. It is originated that the electrons which have strong deoxidization ability produce oxidized free rad- icals anion and oxyhydrogen free radicals after reacting with H2O and O2 dissolved in water. They have strong oxidation ability, and

It is evaluated that optically transparent inorganic polymer derived microchannel showed good performance for photocat- alytic microreaction by decomposition of 4-chlorophenol by photochemistry as much as commercial glass derived microre- actor. In addition, microreactor packed with TiO2 microbeads is effective for photocatalytic reaction by demonstration of steriliza- tion of E. coli. Finally, it is plausible that inorganic polymer based microchannel fabricated facile UV imprinting process is very use- ful as a photochemical microreactor with high optical transparency and excellent stability.

The inorganic polymer microreactor was fabricated by UV- imprinting lithography with stamp prepared by conventional photolithography by using PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, USA), and allylhydridopolycarbosilane (AHPCS, SMP-10 matrix®) mixed

For the comparison of the photocatalytic performance of AHPCS microreactor, glass microreactor and batch reactor, effective pho- tonic energy (UV intensity × exposure area × time) inflicted on reaction site is an important factor; therefore, the energies of batch, glass and AHPCS microreactor were investigated based on the effec- tive exposed area as shown in Fig. 3(a). Measured UV intensity from light source beneath the reactor bottom was 5.64 mW cm−2

[9]. Degussa P25 nanoparticles were mixed in 0.1 mg/�l of concen- tration in water as a slurry type for degradation of 4-chlorophenol (CP) with different concentrations (0.1–6.0 mM) [3]. And the other is TiO2 coated glass microbeads prepared by sol–gel method with TiCl4 0.7 ml in H2O 5 g for 3 h by dipping and thermally annealed at 550 ◦C under air atmosphere for sterilization of microorganism, E. coli (ATCC W3110, KRIBB, Korea). It was cultured in Luria–Bertani media for 8 h until exponential growth phase was reached. All feeds were injected by a syringe pump (PHD 2000, Harvard Apparatus, USA) with 5 �l/min to 20 �l/min of flow rate. UV source was black- light blue lamp (F4T5 BLB, Sankyo, Japan) emitting 352–368 nm of max peaks. The residual 4-CP concentration in samples was analyzed by HPLC system (Younglin M-930 pump) with a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm × 5 �m) by measuring UV absorbance at 254 nm. To calculate the number of live bacteria in eluted sample from microreactor, single colonies were counted on 2% of agar plate media cultured for 24 h after stretching. For the

Titanium dioxide is widely used as a photocatalyst which degrades hydrocarbon under the existence of ultraviolet or increase of hydrophilicity of surface for self-cleaning effect in the fields of surface chemistry as bulk film coating [1,2]. By taking advantage of those unique properties, it is extended to microfluidics for the modification of microchannel surface by growth with TiO2 nanopil- lar or coating of particles. Because it has high surface to volume ratio, diffusion dominated mass transfer effect and easy control- ling of fierce reaction [3,4]. In case of microfluidics, most of cases are glass or quartz based microreactor owing to its optical trans- parency and mechanical stability [5]. According to previous work, the simplest way is to use aqueous dispersed form of Degussa P25, TiO2 nanoparticles as a starting material, by washing and drying the glass or quartz derived micro channel repeatedly which is called ‘wash coat' [6]. And sol–gel process with TiO2 precursor, TiOCl2 or titanium tetraisopropoxide has been applied frequently to form ultra thin film inside the glass microchannel [7]. In these cases,

The optical transmittance of the inorganic polymers coated on glass substrates was measured across the UV–visible range under different curing temperatures (100 ◦C and 160 ◦C). As shown in Fig. 2, cured AHPCS showed a high transmittance (over 90%) from 300 to 700 nm of wavelength range, which is close to that of PDMS sample having the same thickness. It was observed that the AHPCS samples cured at a higher temperature (160 ◦C) showed a slightly lower transmittance which was attributed to their color change from transparent to yellow tinge. It was supposed that higher crosslinkage degree is achieved in higher curing temperature. Nev- ertheless, the optical transparence of AHPCS is promising for their applications in the fabrication of microreactors, in particular when incorporating photo-induced chemistry or optical detections.

optical transmittance with UV–vis spectrophotometer (Avantes, Netherland), the AHPCS films were spin-coated at 1300 rpm on glass slides with 100 �m thickness and cured at 100 ◦C and 160 ◦C in nitrogen atmosphere. In addition, PDMS films were prepared by spin-coating at 1000 rpm and those having the same thickness was used as a reference sample [10].

with 2 wt% of dicumylperoxide (Sigma–Aldrich, USA), and Irgacure 500 (Ciba Specialty, Japan) as a thermal and a photo initiator, respectively, were used as a structural material on glass substrate [8]. Glass microreactor (ICC-DY10, IMT, Japan) with the identical dimensions was used as a reference (Fig. 1). Two kinds of TiO2 pho- tocatalysts were prepared for this work, the one is Degussa P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa AG Company, Germany) which are a fine crystalline powder with a surface area of 55 ± 15 m2 g−1 and particle size in the range 20–200 nm. It is mostly anatase (ca. 80% anatase and 20% rutile), that favors applications in photocatalysis
