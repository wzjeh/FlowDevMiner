compares favorably to typical values of 50–70 emu/g reported else- where in the literature for SPIONs obtained by thermal decomposition in batch type reactors [6,7]. The synthesis yield was determined by UV–VIS spectroscopy ana- lyzing the 350 nm band corresponding to acetylacetonate absorbance [7]. As could be expected, the lowest yield was achieved at the smallest td and vice versa, resulting a yield of 73.1, 80.6 and 86.5% at tm values of 19.2, 27.4 and 38.4 s, respectively. In terms of productivity, these findings implied that the SPIONs production was 0.7 mg/min, 0.5 mg/ min and 0.3 mg/min at tm values of 19.2, 27.4 and 38.4, respectively. This productivity is 50% to 250% higher than that achieved in a comparable batch process previously developed in our laboratory (0.2 mg/min) [7], taking into account: 1) the time required for heating the reagents (15 °C/min nucleation step and 5 °C/min growth stage), 2) reaction time and cooling the SPIONs, 3) reactor volume, 30 mL. It was not possible to compare the productivity of our microreactor against publications from other laboratories because the synthesis yield was not reported in the literature. However, we can compare the residence time required to crystallize SPIONs and the reagents inlet flow used: 1) Simmons et al. used a short residence time but with a low productivity due to the small flow rate (tm = 12 s and 20 μL/min) [19], 2) Abou- Hassan et al. used a tm = 16 min and 136 μL/min [31] and Kumar et al. used a tm = 10.5 min and 200 μL/min [15]. It can be inferred from these data that our microreactor design not only outperforms batch reactors, but also the previous microreactors used for magnetic NPs production, giving a high productivity of monodisperse of SPIONs with a pure and crystalline magnetite phase.

reduced due to the fast heat and mass transfers [13]. In our case the objective for the production of SPIONs was to lower the reaction times to minutes, rather than the timescale of hours required in batch type reactors [6,7]. However, the blockage of microchannels can be a major concern. This phenomenon is caused either by NP agglomeration and sedimentation at the low linear rates usually employed in micro- reactors, or by a preferential heterogeneous nucleation in the wall surfaces of microchannels. To study this problem two single-plate mi- croreactors were assembled in series to better control the nucleation and growth stages (Figs. 1-c and 2): 1) Nucleation microreactor and 2) Growth microreactor. We found that if the tm value of the microreactor in which growth takes place were larger than 27.4 s, the SPIONs pro- duction was not stable and the microfluidic system blocked after a time lapse of several minutes. The main microchannel fouling was occurring at the curved channel sections, where the slow flow rates (< 300 μL/ min) and low linear velocities promote the sedimentation of aggregates that eventually block the microchannel. To circumvent this problem tm was decreased by increasing the reagent flow rates. Fig. 2 illustrates the SPIONs produced at diﬀerent tm values: 9.6 s, 19.2 s and 27.4 s. A black and stable colloid was obtained in all tested conditions, assuring the

The experimental system consists of two consecutive stainless steel microreactors. The first microreactor was heated at 180 °C, while the second one was heated at 280 °C. This configuration is intended to emulate the batch-synthesis procedure reported by Cai et al. [6], where the batch reactor was sequentially heated at 180 °C and 280 °C for 30 min in each heating stage. The microreactor plates were similar to those used by Jensen et al. [20,21] based on metal plates, but the design was adapted for the specific needs of this process, as described below. The microreactor consists of a stainless steel (AISI 316) plate (88 mm × 50 mm × 0.5 mm) patterned with two diﬀerent zones (Fig. 1-a, b): 1) Mixing zone, using a meandering microchannel to promote a fast passive mixing [22] and 2) Reaction zone, a spiral mi- crochannel that minimizes the fouling process during particle growth [22]. The plates were fabricated using a chemical etching procedure developed by Exella (Exella Europe SRL—www.exella.es), (Fig. 1-b). The microchannels were 370 μm wide, with a depth of 150 μm being the reactor volume of 160 μL. The plate had three fluid inlet ports and one outlet port. The plate was compressed in an aluminum block and contacted with high-tem- perature resistant polymeric gaskets (TEADIT® NA1122), (Fig. 1-f). The plates were assembled with diﬀerent configurations to optimize the nanocrystallization reaction and to control the particle size distribution: 1) Individual (Fig. 1-d), 2) In series to separate the nucleation and growth stages (Fig. 1-c) and 3) Stacking several plates to increase the microreactor volume and to increase the SPIONs productivity (Fig. 1-e). There were two options to assemble the stacked plates: 1) In parallel by splitting the inlet flow and 2) In series, where the inlet flow is not split. Both options obey the same value of tm (residence time, Eq. (1)), but we selected the assembled of plates in series to increase the linear velocity and to prevent microchannel blockage.

SPIONs [14,15,18] as well as in the synthesis of other nanomaterials [11,25]. However, droplet-flow reactors involve the formation of the NPs in aqueous droplets within an oil-based carrier phase. The oil phase and the surfactants used to control droplet size must be subsequently separated from the formed nanoparticles [19], which is not always possible, in addition to the economic cost of separation. The microfluidic system composed of two microreactors assembled in series with two stacked plates was selected to investigate the prop- erties of the SPIONs produced at tm higher than 27.4 s. Fig. 5-a depicts the TEM images and particle size distribution of SPIONs produce with tm of 38.4 s (Flow rate = 500 μL/min). The production of SPIONs at these conditions was stable and no microchannel blockage was ob- served. Spiral microchannels exhibit transverse Dean flows due to the centrifugal forces [26]. These centrifugal eﬀects are enhanced at high values of Re number (Re > 100) [27] and induce the formation of counter-rotating vortices that promote the mixing and reduce the pos- sibility of aggregate sedimentation, and then microchannel blockage. Considering that the Re value was increased up to 150 by stacking two plates in the microreactor, it can be argued that both a flow rate larger than 500 μL/min and two plates are required to enable a con- tinuous production of SPIONS with tm > 27.4 s. However, an increase of tm above 38.4 s also resulted in the microfluidic channels blockage and therefore an increase in the number of stacked plates together with larger flow rates would be required to avoid the microchannel blockage. The mean particle size achieved with tm = 38.4 s, 3.8 ± 0.8 nm, is the same as that obtained at tm of 27.4 s (Fig. 5-b). The mean nanoparticle size was comparable to that observed by Simmons et al. (3.6 ± 1 nm) [19], Frenz et al. (4.0 ± 1 nm) [14] and Kumar et al. (3.6 ± 0.8 nm) [15] and improved the size distribution yielded in a batch – type reactor (5.0 ± 2 nm) [7]. XRD spectra also confirmed the presence of pure magnetite nanocrystals with a preferential growth

SPIONs have been synthesized for the first time in a continuous flow using a high temperature decomposition method. This method enables the dispersion in water of produced SPIONs, as well as eases their use in biomedical applications because TEG is an organic solvent with reduced toxicity. In spite of the high temperatures used (280 °C) the micro- reactor system can operate for prolonged periods without microchannel plugging. The flexible design allows to increase the production rate by coupling microreactors with stacked plates. In first-stage microreactors, nucleation takes place by decomposition of the Fe precursor at 180 °C. In the second microreactor, the fast growth of nuclei occurred at 280 °C and monodisperse SPIONs were produced with a yield as high as 86.5%, high crystallinity, high purity (100% magnetite) and magnetization, with total residence times of 76 s or lower.

reproducibility, and low reagent consumption during optimization [11]. In addition, the problems posed by fast kinetically-controlled re- actions can be overcome thanks to: 1) the small reaction volumes in- volved, 2) the high surface to volume ratio of microchannels and 3) the high heat and mass transfer rates. Seminal work in polymer-based [14–18], and glass-based microreactors [19], has clearly shown the benefits of using microfluidic reactors to produce magnetic nano- particles. However, these synthesis procedures were carried out at low temperatures (< 90 °C) following the co-precipitation method. Con- sidering that crystallinity and then, magnetization, are improved by a higher synthesis temperature [7] and that co-precipitation is not as precise in terms of size control as the thermal decomposition technique, the aim of this work is the development of an scalable and reproducible procedure capable to produce SPIONs continuously at high tempera- tures (> 200 °C) using the thermal decomposition polyol-based process. To this end, we have designed a microfluidic platform based on mi- cropatterned plates to achieve excellent control in the continuous production of SPIONs from the thermal decomposition of Fe iron(III) acetylacetonate [Fe(acac)3].

The results obtained using a staged assembly of plates to separate the nucleation and growth stages, were compared to those on a single microreactor operating either at 180 °C or at 280 °C (Fig. 3-a). An or- ange-colored solution (similar to the reagent solution injected) resulted after operating the microfluidic system at 180 °C. This solution did not contain any SPIONs or at least, the size was too small to be magnetically separated after the purification steps. The decomposition temperature of iron(III) acetylacetonate is approximately 180 °C [7]; this fact could

The reproducibility of key nanomaterial features is essential in nanomedicine applications where small changes of physical characteristics often lead to a very diﬀerent behavior. In this regard, continuous microreactors are often advocated as a means to achieve highly precise synthesis of nanomaterials. However, when the synthesis must take place at high temperatures the use of these devices becomes restricted in terms of materials and practical problems (e.g. plugging of microchannels). Here we present the continuous synthesis of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) through a polyol-based process at high temperatures (> 200 °C). The microfluidic reactor designed allows SPION production at residence times under 1 min, was able to work continuously for 8 h without channel blockage and reached high production yields by coupling mi- croreactors using stacked plates. The eﬀect of operating conditions was optimized to produce homogeneous particles with a narrow particle size distribution. In summary, the microreactor developed in this work enables easy-to scale up, reproducible continuous production of SPIONs.

explain the negligible growth of nanocrystals under those conditions. In fact, this temperature was selected in previous studies to promote the formation of just nuclei [6,7]. On the other hand, a black colloid was obtained after heating the microreactor at 280 °C (Fig. 3-a). TEM ana- lysis evidenced the production of SPIONs with a heterogeneous size distribution, exhibiting a large dispersity (Fig. 3-b, c). XRD spectra confirmed the presence of a pure magnetite phase (Fig. 3-d). The un- even nucleation achieved at 280 °C prevented the segregation between the nuclei formation and growth, i.e., new nuclei were formed while the growth of previously formed nuclei was also taking place. In the solu- tion coexisted large NPs that grew faster than the small NPs formed more recently. These results confirmed the need of separating stages in order to better control the particle size distribution. Leveraging the versatility of the microreactor designed, the number of micropatterned plates was increased by stacking two plates in each microreactor. The microreactor volume increase exerted the advantages of: 1) Increasing the productivity at fixed tm value and 2) to explore new reaction conditions (tm and linear velocity) that were not pre- viously feasible due to microchannel clogging. With high flow rates, the linear velocity is, preventing the microchannel fouling and blockage. This microfluidic configuration with stacked plates successfully ran the SPIONs production for at least 8 h without blockage. The quality of the SPIONs collected was studied along the 8 h of operation time, observing a good reproducibility along operation time. The SPIONs collected at diﬀerent runs also corroborated that the proposed microsystem was able to assure a good run-to-run reproducibility.

control the setup temperature (Fig. 1 g, h). A 9.4 mM of Fe(acac)3 in TEG solution was loaded in high-pressure stainless steel syringes (Harvard Apparatus) and introduced by means of syringe pumps (Harvard Apparatus PHD Ultra™ CP 4400), ensuring a good control of the flow rates with very low pulsation. The syringes and heating blocks were connected to 1/16″ stainless-steel tubing. Following SPIONs synthesis by thermal decomposition, the nanoparticles were purified by adding a mixture of ethyl acetate and ethanol (2:1) to the SPIONs with a 5:1 v/v (washing mixture: SPIONs) and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to yield a black solid and supernatant containing unused reactants.

Single phase microreactor for the continuous, high-temperature synthesis of < 4 nm superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles

SPIONs production for 8 h without blockage. The black color was in- dicative that no Fe3+ oxo-hydroxides were formed [18]. TEM analysis of representative SPIONs synthesized under diﬀerent tm revealed that isotropic NPs were produced with a lognormal size distribution of mean particle size smaller than 4 nm. The data showed that doubling tm from 9.6 s to 19.2 s produced larger SPIONs (3.4 ± 0.6 nm vs. 2.3 ± 0.6 nm). However, an additional increase of residence time to tm = 27.4 s did not cause a further modification of the SPIONs size (3.5 ± 0.8 nm), the slight variation on the particle size observed is not statistically significant. Interestingly, XRD diﬀraction analysis revealed that all tested conditions yielded pure magnetite na- nocrystals. This is an excellent achievement because it is common to have a mixture of iron oxide phases when the batch reaction is trans- lated to a microreactor process [15,19]. The broad peaks of XRD spectra are in agreement with the small crystallite size of the SPIONs produced. The crystalline structure is sensitive to tm, SPIONs produced with a tm = 9.6 s have a greater tendency to promote the growth of (222) planes, whereas a long residence time (19.2 s or 27.4 s) promoted the preferential growth of (311) and (440) planes. The low signal-to-noise ratio of XRD spectra collected form SPIONs produced at tm = 9.6

The aluminum block was equipped with four heating cartridges to assure a homogenous heating and thermocouples were included to

Transmission electron microscopy observations were carried using a T20‐FEI microscope with a LaB6 electron source fitted with a "SuperTwin®" objective lens allowing a point‐to‐point resolution of 2.4 Å. A 10μL suspension of purified SPIONs was pipetted onto a TEM copper grid having a continuous carbon film. Samples were let to evaporate completely and then analyzed. Aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs-corrected STEM) images were acquired at LMA-INA-UNIZAR using a high angle annular dark field detector in a FEI XFEG TITAN electron microscope operated at 300 kV equipped with a CETCOR Cs-probe corrector from CEOS Company al- lowing formation of an electron probe of 0.08 nm. The yield of the reaction was studied by UV–VIS spectroscopy (V- 670 Jasco Co.) analyzing the 350 nm band corresponding to acet- ylacetonate [7]. Magnetic behavior of the samples was studied, at 37 °C (considering potential physiological applications), in a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device magnetometer (SQUID) from Quantum Design's, model MPMS-XL. The analysis of the magnetic phase, crystalline properties and purity was studied by X-ray diﬀraction. The analyses were carried out using a Philips X-Pert diﬀractometer equipped with a monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV, 20 mA) from 25 to 80° with a step size of 0.013°.

of (311) and (440) crystallographic planes (Fig. 5-c). High resolution microscopy revealed that SPIONs produced with a tm = 38.4 s are single crystals with a high crystallinity (Fig. 5e and f). Interplanar spacing could be directly determined from the images by measuring the lattice fringes, and it was approximately 0.29 nm, which corresponds to the (220) planes in the spinel-structured magnetite [28]. On the other hand, Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) was also performed on the HRTEM images of single particles. The FFT spectra image confirmed the presence of (220) and (440) crystallographic planes. The lattice parameter a (8.36 Å) and interplanar spacing dhkl (2.96 Å), determined by Braggs law from the position of the (220) peak by XRD diﬀraction, are in complete agreement with the spinel crystal structure of bulk Fe3O4 (8.39 Å) and the interplanar spacing measured by HRTEM, re- spectively. On the other hand, the magnetization values showed that the par- ticles prepared at the two diﬀerent tm = 19.2 and 38.4 s (Fig. 5-d) present superparamagnetic behavior with no coercivity or remanent magnetization up to 4 Tesla (Fig. 5-d-inset). The resulting nanoparticles yielded overall magnetic moments lower than those measured for pure magnetite samples (i.e., 92 emu/g) which is attributed to the increased disorder at the particle surfaces as the particle size decreases [29]. The particles obtained with a shorter residence time (19.2 s) produced a magnetic moment at 4 Tesla and 37 °C of only 24 emu/g Fe whereas the particles obtained with tm = 38.4 s showed a magnetic moment at the same conditions of 64 emu/g Fe. This can be attributed to a reduced crystallinity for the nanoparticles obtained at shorter residence times in agreement with the previous literature [30]. This was confirmed by comparing the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (311) dif- fraction plane for both materials (results not shown), corroborating broader peaks for the particles obtained at shorter residence time (19.2 s). The saturation magnetization achieved with tm = 38.4 s
