In recent years, microchannel reactor technology has demonstrated considerable potential in chemical synthesis. Compared to conventional batch reactors [21,22], continuous-flow microchannel reactors offer distinct advantages, including a high surface area-to-volume ratio,

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the continuous-flow microreactor system comprises three core subsystems: a modular microreactor assembly, an LED illumination unit, and a temperature control module (Fig. 1(a)).The microreactor assembly integrates five functional segments: a premixing module (Fig. 1(b)) followed by four coiled FEP reaction modules (Fig. 1 (c)). Each reaction module has a coil configuration with 45 m length and dimensional parameters of 3 mm OD (outer diameter) / 2 mm ID (inner diameter).The LED unit employs uniformly distributed matrix arrays on bilateral sides to ensure homogeneous irradiance. The temperature control system incorporates integrated heating/cooling elements for precise thermal uniformity.

mostatted plunger pump and fed into the reaction system. Simulta- neously, Gas B (Cl₂) was delivered from a high-pressure cylinder regulated by a pressure-reducing valve and mass flow controller. The two streams underwent premixing before entering the microchannel reactor. Reaction progression occurred under controlled temperature and pressure. Upon completion, the effluent was collected at the reactor outlet. Unreacted Cl₂ and byproduct HCl were scrubbed with 2M NaOH solution. System pressure was maintained using a back-pressure valve positioned downstream. Reaction products and byproducts were char- acterized by ¹H-NMR, ¹³C-NMR, and GC-MS analyses. (See Supporting Information Fig. S1-S3).

The implementation of a microchannel reactor facilitates precise control of reaction feedstocks within a confined space, ensuring reaction accuracy while preventing back-mixing. Furthermore, the system effi- ciently dissipates excess process heat, establishing stable external con- ditions that enhance product purity while significantly improving target product yield and selectivity. This approach not only accelerates chlo- rination kinetics but also partially mitigates safety concerns associated with liquid chlorine.

Using BPO as a radical initiator and Cl₂ as the chlorine source, the chlorination of EC to synthesize CEC was successfully carried out in a microchannel reactor under UV irradiation. The optimal process pa- rameters were determined to be a reaction temperature of 85◦C, Cl₂ to EC molar ratio of 0.48:1, residence time of 18.5 min, three cycles, wavelength of 254 nm, light intensity of 120 W, and BPO initiator concentration of 1.5 wt%. Under these conditions, the EC conversion reached 99.5%, and the CEC yield was 84.1%.

The sharp increase in EC conversion at 12.5 min may be attributed to homogeneous gas-liquid mixing within the microchannel reactor, which forms a gas-in-liquid dispersion favorable for interfacial reactions. In contrast, the significant decline in EC conversion at residence times beyond 25 min is likely due to the transition to a liquid-in-gas disper- sion, where uneven mixing reduces mass transfer efficiency. Therefore,

In microchannel reactor systems, the residence time of reactants is another critical factor influencing the reaction, as it indirectly de- termines the effective duration of light exposure during the photo- catalytic process. The effect of residence time on the reaction was investigated at 85◦C and an EC:Cl₂ molar ratio of 1:0.48. As shown in Fig. 5, EC conversion initially increased with residence time, rising sharply at 12.5 min before peaking at 38.9% at 18.5 min. Beyond this residence time, conversion gradually declined, with a significant drop observed at 25 min.

The conversion of EC and the selectivities toward dichloroethylene carbonate (DCEC) and chloroethylene carbonate (CEC), along with the yield of CEC, were calculated using the following equations:

Under the conditions of an EC:Cl₂ molar ratio of 1:0.48, an 18.5 min residence time, three cycles, and 120 W light intensity, the influence of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) initiator concentration on chlorinated ethylene carbonate (CEC) yield was investigated. As depicted in Fig. 7, both CEC conversion and selectivity increased initially with rising BPO concen- tration but began to decline beyond an optimal point. Specifically, increasing the BPO concentration from 0.4 wt% to 1.5 wt% enhanced CEC conversion significantly, from 55.9% to 99.5%. However, further increases in BPO concentration resulted in a gradual decrease in conversion.

As the number of cycles increased, the initial EC to Cl₂ molar ratio decreased. This led to lower chlorine utilization efficiency and CEC selectivity, while EC conversion and DCEC selectivity increased. Sub- sequently, the CEC yield initially rose but then declined. Therefore, three cycles were determined to be optimal, corresponding to an ideal initial EC to Cl₂ molar ratio of 1:0.48. Under these conditions, the C-H chlorination of EC in a microchannel reactor demonstrated superior performance compared to batch reactors, achieving higher chlorine utilization efficiency, shorter reaction times, and greater product yields. For comparison, similar chlorination reactions in batch reactors require an optimal EC to Cl₂ molar ratio of approximately 1:2 [20].

rination of ethylene carbonate (EC) within a continuous-flow micro- channel reactor under specific wavelengths and light intensities. The primary reaction products were identified as chloroethylene carbonate (CEC) and dichloroethylene carbonate (DCEC), achieving a CEC selec- tivity of ≥80.0%, which demonstrates excellent selectivity under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, while maintaining the molar ratio of EC to Cl₂ at 1:0.48, the conversion of EC increased from 8.5% to 38.9% as the reaction temperature was raised from 50◦C to 85◦C.However, CEC selectivity decreased dramatically from 100% to 95.9%, while DCEC selectivity increased from 0% to 3.2%. A further increase in reaction temperature beyond 85◦C resulted in a modest rise in EC conversion, accompanied by a gradual decline in CEC selectivity from 95.9% to 90.5% and a corresponding increase in DCEC selectivity from 3.2% to 6.4%.

Under fixed conditions of an EC:Cl₂ molar ratio of 1:0.48, an 18.5 minute residence time, three reaction cycles, 120 W light intensity, and a 1.5 wt% initiator concentration, the performance of different initiators in the C-H chlorination reaction was compared. As presented in Table 2, AIBN demonstrated significantly lower efficacy than ABVN, BPO, and the BPO/AIBN combination. Among these initiators, BPO outperformed ABVN but was slightly less effective than the BPO/AIBN mixture. This performance trend is likely attributable to the higher ac- tivity of BPO compared to both AIBN and ABVN.

at this ratio. At an EC:Cl₂ molar ratio of 1:0.48, the reaction achieved an optimal balance, yielding an EC conversion of 38.9%, a high chlorine utilization efficiency of 81.7%, a significant CEC yield of 37.3%, and a low DCEC selectivity of 3.2%. Therefore, the optimal EC to Cl₂ molar ratio was identified as 1:0.48.

The photothermal chlorination of ethylene carbonate (EC) using liquid chlorine and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) initiator offers a green approach to C-H chlorination. However, batch reactors present challenges including prolonged reaction times and low chlorine utilization efficiency. These limitations may be effectively overcome through microchannel reactor technology. This study developed a green, safe process for selectively chlorinating EC to chloroethylene carbonate (CEC). In the microchannel reactor, liquid chlorine served as chlorinating agent and BPO as initiator under UV irradiation. After parameter optimization, the optimal conditions achieved 99.5% EC conversion and 84.1% CEC yield.
