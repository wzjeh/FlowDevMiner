A notable advantage of this reactor system was demon- strated through obtaining 88 experimental data point efficiently at wide range of conditions, and a continuous 20 h test run on stream which cannot be done in a typical batch reactor testing system, with no discernible loss in conversion or selectivity observed. The performance of the Pd@UiO-66 MOF catalyst followed a conversion-selectivity trend like other Pd-based catalysts for selective hydrogenation. Notably, it displays high activity with short residence time at the scale of seconds even at lower value of operating temperature and pressure. The best result with high PA conversion of 98.9% was at 70% ST selectivity, while maximum selectivity was of 92.3% was reached for PA conversion less than 20%. The lowest H2 pressure bar and highest temperature demonstrating the importance of having low H2 concentration on ST selectivity as claimed in the literature. Although the tested MOF catalyst in this study was not optimized and exhibited lower selectivity-conversion perform-

While selective hydrogenation has been successfully con- ducted in microreactors with controlled conversion and selectivity using homogeneous catalysts or heterogeneous catalysts in the form of beads, extrudates, or catalyst-coated channel walls, packed-bed powder catalyst testing in micro- reactors for multiphase flow remains least explored in the literature.[49–54]

our work. Additionally, we highlight our reactor system and approach to do early-stage screening of catalytic materials. Clearly, the predominant choice of reactor for testing new catalysts in the literature is batch reactor, typically utilizing milligram quantities of catalyst. However, a common limitation across reported batch reactor studies can be clearly observed. Test conditions are often constrained to fixed values of temper- ature, pressure, and concentration, with only a single work presenting an extensive analysis across a broad spectrum of conditions (17 variations in temperature, pressure, and concen- tration). Furthermore, reaction times in batch reactors typically span from minutes to hours, with none achieving reaction times on the scale of seconds. Catalyst stability assessments in batch reactors typically involve multiple reuse experiments, ranging from 3 to 6 cycles. In contrast, flow reactor testing proofs valuable to address these raised limitations. In all reported studies, flow reactors offer distinct advantages by enabling testing across a broader range of temperature, pressure, and concentration conditions, while also facilitating extended time- on-stream stability testing, with residence times ranging from seconds to minutes, and in some instances, hours. However, flow reactor introduces additional complexity, particularly when processing gas-liquid-solid multiphases reaction system. Our study highlighted this critical factor that is why maintaining Taylor flow was essential to get reproducible results. Regarding the performance of the Pd@UiO-66 catalyst in this work, it exhibits satisfactory conversion, selectivity, and stability compared to other reported catalysts, even under milder reaction conditions. Notably, the entire reaction process occurs within seconds, a departure from the typical literature reports, and multiple conditions were evaluated smoothly, including effective time-on-stream stability testing, demonstrat- ing the efficiency of flow reactor-based approaches over tradi- tional batch methods.

lowest H2 pressure of 0.28 bar, it indicates that the best ST selectivity is reached with the lowest H2 concentration. This result is in agreement with a previously reported work which showed that controlling the H2 concentration is essential for maximizing the ST selectivity.[64]

Table S1 (in supplementary file) shows the experimental conditions used in this work. In total 8 temperature and pressure set points were tested at different liquid flow rates (0.1 to 4 mL/min) which resulted in collecting 88 experimental data points. Phenylacetylene concentration at 0.2 mol/L, and H2 flow at 5 mL/min were kept fixed in this work. Before each reaction, H2 was passed over the catalyst for 15 min under the tested reaction conditions. No further pretreatment or catalyst activa- tion steps were required. The reaction started when feeding the phenylacetylene liquid solution.

flow rates with a fixed gas flow rate. Figure 2(b) shows a flow regime map for gas-liquid flow in a microchannel reactor with an emphasis on the Taylor flow regime. Before performing the catalytic experiments, a study was carried out to define the upper and lower flow rates to maintain the Taylor flow regime before the feed reaches the catalyst bed. Maintaining a stable flow regime was essential to get reproducible catalyst testing results.

The initial selectivity to ST is plotted versus the rate of PA and EB as shown in Figure 6. The ST selectivity to PA does not change much at different conditions, but it does for the ST selectivity to EB. This demonstrates the influence of the operating conditions to optimize the ST selectivity. Also, it proves that this testing system and approach can capture variation in reaction systems at different conditions. Doing this in a batch reactor system will be tedious and would require a larger amount of catalyst quantity. The highest obtained ST selectivity to EB is observed at lower temperatures and moderate pressures. This could indicate the balance that needs to be carried out on the available hydrogen concentration in the system as reported in the literature for a similar reaction system.[64] Further elaborating on the selectivity trends and their explanations will be given in section 3.4.

pressures spanning 0.28 to 8 bar. Styrene selectivity within the range of 80–92.3% was achieved at phenylacetylene conver- sions below 20%. Notably, the optimal condition for styrene selectivity (70%) was attained at 98.9% phenylacetylene conversion under the lowest H2 pressure and highest temper- ature, demonstrating the significance of low H2 concentration for achieving optimal styrene selectivity. Remarkably, the catalyst exhibited stable activity and selectivity over a 20 h testing period, indicating its robust performance under pro- longed reaction conditions. This study demonstrates the potential of the proposed catalyst testing system as a rapid and efficient approach for early-stage exploration studies, particu- larly when limited quantities of catalyst, typically in the gram scale or less, are available.

advanced catalytic applications can be achieved like electro- catalysis, photocatalysis and tandem catalysis.[14,15] However, the vast array of MOFs necessitates a rapid and efficient method for screening and identifying promising catalysts. Most MOF catalyst testing is currently performed in batch or semi-batch stirred reactors due to their operational simplicity and suitability for testing catalysts available in limited quantities.[16] However, flow reactors offer distinct advantages over batch systems for catalyst testing.[17,18] Microreactors, in particular, have emerged as powerful tools for laboratory experimentation, requiring only milligram quantities of catalysts and enabling rapid and precise screening of various conditions, thus facilitating early-stage exploration studies.[19] Although loading catalysts as powders in fixed packed beds is a straightforward option in microreactors, it poses challenges such as pressure drop limitations and uneven flow distribution.[20,21] Addressing these challenges through additive manufacturing or catalyst coating on channel walls is less viable for early-stage exploration due to the need for substantial material quantities to optimize synthesis recipes, thus making packed bed microreactors the preferred option. While catalyst testing in packed-bed reactors with diameters larger than 4 mm is well-established, significant differences in testing results are observed in reactors with smaller channel diameters, particularly micro-packed-bed reactors, especially in multiphase flow systems.[22–24] Among various flow regimes in microreactors, Taylor flow stands out due to its well-controlled interface, enhanced mixing and heating, and minimized back

To benchmark the Pd@UiO-66 catalyst as a selective hydro- genating catalyst, a similar Pd/Al2O3 catalyst from the literature is shown in Figure 8(d). In that test, different Pd NP sizes were tested at similar conditions for the same hydrogenation reaction.[30] The result from this work follows a similar trend as that from the literature. However, they have higher values for ST selectivity and better results at higher PA conversion. Their work was done at optimal conditions of Pd particle size and with no internal mass transfer limitation. The work of Vergunst et. al,[62] showed that internal mass transfer has a major influence on the yield and selectivity of ST and EB. This is also evidenced in the work Cherkasov et. al,[23] who showed a reduction in the performance of the same catalysts in the micro-packed bed reactor compared to the coated capillary. Evaluating the effect of mass transfer limitation requires testing

The initial rate of reaction for phenylacetylene is calculated and plotted for all tested operating conditions as shown in Figure 6. For all conditions, the rate of reaction was the highest for phenylacetylene, followed by styrene, and then ethylbenzene. Increasing the pressure and temperature, in the beginning, increases the initial rate of reaction in a linear way. However, it started to level off at higher pressures and temperatures, indicating that the rate of reaction started to reach a limit. At higher temperatures, this explained by the balance reached between increasing the rate of reaction with the reduced H2 solubility. The balance reached at higher pressures indicating that the rate of the reaction could be limited by another factor. Most probably this is caused by the rate of internal mass transfer which is dominant for larger catalyst particle sizes, larger than tenths of micrometers.[62] Using the trend for the initial increase in PA rate, a reaction order of one can be assumed for hydrogen and PA which matches the literature.[63]

This study aims to address two main objectives. Firstly, to evaluate an approach for testing catalysts available only at gram scale or less for demanding multiphase gas-liquid-solid reactions in a flow reactor system. Secondly, to demonstrate the potential and capability of MOF-based catalysts for selective hydrogenation in a gas-liquid-solid reactor. Specifically, a packed-bed microreactor operated under a gas-liquid Taylor flow regime is employed for the selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene, utilizing UiO-66 containing Pd NPs embedded in the pores as the catalyst. The study explores the operating window and requirements for packing MOF catalysts in the microreactor, with a focus on maintaining Taylor flow for reproducible results. The reaction performance is evaluated under various liquid flow rates, temperatures, and pressures, including long-time on-stream testing to check catalyst stabil- ity.
