conversion over the Au/Al2O3 catalyst was further studied at different reaction temperatures. The residence time (t) was fixed at a constant H2 flow rate of 60 mLmin�1. Thus, during all experiments, a large excess of H2 was maintained in the reac- tion media (inlet H2/3-VNB molar ratio>35) to avoid external mass-transfer limitations. Figure 3a displays the 3-VNB conver- sion measured 30–38 min after the start of the experiment versus t for three different reaction temperatures. The experi- mental data are described by Equation (1):

Hydrogenation of substituted nitrobenzenes in organic medium (toluene) to the corresponding anilines was performed under con- tinuous-flow conditions in a H-Cube Pro setup (Thalesnano, Hun- gary) equipped with an electrolytic cell for the generation of high- purity hydrogen by in situ water electrolysis, a conventional HPLC pump for delivering a liquid reactant, and a touch-screen module for automatic control of operational parameters (reaction tempera- ture and pressure, flow rates of hydrogen and liquid substrate, etc.). A more detailed description of the H-Cube Pro setup has been published elsewhere.[13a,26] A stainless-steel packed-bed Cat- Cart30 reactor (catalyst cartridge) of 30 mm in length and 4.0 mm in inner diameter (volume 0.38 cm3) preloaded with a catalyst sample (0.185 g) was installed in a stainless-steel heater controlled by using the Peltier unit. Immediately prior to the catalytic run, pure toluene solvent was passed through the connecting lines and reactor at a flow rate of 0.5 mLmin�1 to remove air. After air was removed from the connecting line and reactor, the desired reaction parameters were selected and the mixture of hydrogen and sol- vent was fed to the reactor in up-flow mode with a rate of 60 and 0.5 mLmin�1, respectively, until the required temperature and pres- sure were reached. The inlet was then switched to the flask filled with a 0.05m solution of an organic substrate in toluene contain- ing n-decane as an internal standard. This moment was chosen as the starting point of the reaction. The liquid flow was mixed with hydrogen in a gas/liquid mixer and fed to the reactor at a rate of 0.5 mLmin�1. The catalytic tests were usually performed at 60– 1108C, with a hydrogen pressure and flow rate of 10 bar and 60 mLmin�1, respectively. Typically, collection of the first sample of liquid product for analysis started 30 min after feeding of the sub- strate and continued for 4 min; immediately thereafter, the second sample was taken for another 4 min. The conversion of substituted nitrobenzene, selectivity to the determined product, and yield were calculated based on mean analysis results for these samples. Because the catalytic activity was reduced gradually under the ex- perimental conditions, a fresh catalyst sample was taken for each catalytic run. The inlet and outlet concentrations of substrate and products were analyzed by means of a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with a flame-ionization detector (FID) and a capil- lary HP 5-MS column (60 m�0.32 mm�0.25 mm). Reaction prod- ucts were identified by GC/MS by using an Agilent 7000B Triple Quad System equipped with an HP 5-MS column. The conversion of substituted nitrobenzene, X (%), and the selectivity, S (%), to the determined product were calculated by using Equations (4) and (5), respectively:

This study demonstrated the possibility of highly selective hy- drogenation of a nitro group in a series of substituted nitro- benzenes with the general formula XC6H4NO2, containing other reactive functionalities (X=Cl, CH=CH2, or C(O)CH3), in a contin- uous-flow three-phase reactor by using a nanodispersed Au/ Al2O3 catalyst at lower temperatures than those usually used in batch reactors. The overall feed stream, which comprised of hydrogen and a solution of a substituted nitrobenzene in tolu- ene, was passed through a packed catalyst bed at 60–1108C and 10 bar in up-flow mode; hydrogen was fed to the reactor at a high flow rate (�30 mLmin�1) to avoid external mass- transfer limitations. One important result found was that hy- drogenation of isomeric CNBs over the Au/Al2O3 catalyst under the above conditions gave the targeted CANs with almost 100% yield (100% selectivity at nearly 100% conversion); no formation of dechlorination products was detected. Increasing the reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure promoted the complete hydrogenation of nitroso intermediates, and thus, avoided the formation of products of their condensation with CPHA. Hydrogenation of 4-ANB and 3-VNB led to the for- mation of 3-VAN and 4-AAN with selectivities of up to 93 and 97% at substrate conversions as high as 98 and 100%, respec- tively. In these cases, increasing the reaction temperature fa- vored C=C and C=O hydrogenation and resulted in minor det- rimental changes in selectivity to the target anilines. A smooth deactivation of the catalyst with time on-stream was observed, regardless of which substituted nitrobenzene was used in hy- drogenation. TEM and TPO studies of the Au/Al2O3 catalyst after testing for 3-VNB hydrogenation at 808C showed a nearly twofold increase in the mean surface diameter of gold particles during the reaction and the appearance of carbonaceous de- posit on the catalyst surface which might block catalytically active sites. Oxidative regeneration of the spent catalyst sample in a flow of air at 4008C restored its activity almost to the starting level with retention of high selectivity to 3-VAN. Taking this into consideration, we can suggest that the forma- tion of carbonaceous deposit, which was probably promoted by Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites of the alumina support, was the main reason for catalyst deactivation. Thus, research efforts should be directed toward preventing this by modification of the support surface and optimization of reaction parameters. Aggregation of gold nanoparticles during the reaction seems to be less important, although understanding the reasons for and preventing this phenomenon are also an essential goal.

nitroaromatic compound in toluene) seems to be the rate-de- termining step of the process. At higher flow rates of H2 (�30 mLmin�1), the conversion of nitroaromatic compound and selectivity for hydrogenation of a nitro group are inde- pendent of the gas velocity, which indicates that, under these conditions, external mass-transfer limitations are absent. Sub- sequently, all catalytic tests were performed at a high hydro- gen flow rate of 60 mLmin�1. As a result of special tests, we found that an enlargement of the catalyst grain sizes from 125–250 to 350–500 mm had no considerable effect on the conversion measured at a hydrogen flow rate of 60 mLmin�1, which implied negligible influence of internal mass transfer under the conditions used.

for nitroso intermediates and its condensation products de- creases, whereas selectivity to CANs increases accordingly. The 2-CAN product is formed from 2-CNB over the Au/Al2O3 cata- lyst in quantitative yield at a H2 pressure of 10 bar and temper- ature as low as 908C, whereas obtaining the target product (3- CAN) through the hydrogenation of 3-CNB in 100% yield at the same pressure requires temperatures of not less than 1108C (Table 1, entries 3 and 7). Finally, quantitative production of 4-CAN from 4-CNB requires not only to increasing the reac- tion temperature to 1108C, but also increasing the hydrogen pressure to 40 bar (Table 1, entry 10). The difference observed in the product distributions of the hydrogenation of different isomeric CNBs under identical conditions may be related to the fact that the rate of interconversions of CNSB and its con- densation products, as well as the rate of their transformation to CAN, depend on the mutual positions of the Cl atom and nitro group in the benzene ring.

The time-on stream performance of the Au/Al2O3 catalyst under the conditions of liquid-phase hydrogenation of substi- tuted nitrobenzenes in a packed-bed flow reactor was studied at 808C and the hydrogen pressure of 10 bar for up to 2 h of continuous operation. During this period, liquid samples of the reaction flow were taken every 20 min at the reactor outlet and analyzed by GC. As a result, smooth deactivation of the catalyst with time on-stream was observed, regardless of the substrate used for hydrogenation. As an example, Figure 4a

Hydrogenation of a nitro group in nitroaromatic compounds over supported gold catalysts may be limited by the external transfer of reactants to the catalyst surface and not by reaction kinetics. Studying the liquid-phase hydrogenation of benzene and a-methylstyrene over solid catalysts under continuous- flow conditions, which in many ways are similar to those exam- ined herein, shows that external mass transfer is enhanced if the hydrogen flow rate at the reactor inlet is enlarged.[15] By taking this into account, a set of experiments was performed to examine the effect of hydrogen flow rate on the conversion of substituted nitrobenzene (3-VNB) over the Au/Al2O3 catalyst by increasing the H2 flow rate from 8 to 60 mLmin�1 at a con- stant liquid velocity of 0.5 mLmin�1. Figure 2 illustrates the typ- ical dependence of conversion and reaction selectivity on the flow rate of H2 and reflects the existence of two regions. At low flow rates of H2 from 8 to 30 mLmin�1, the conversion in- creases with increasing gas velocity. In this case, external mass transfer (most probably, dissolution of H2 into the solution of

demonstrates the time dependence of 3-VNB conversion and selectivity to 3-VAN over the Au/Al2O3 catalyst. A reduction in the conversion level from 98.5 to 79.5% occurred after 2 h on stream, whereas the selectivity remained practically unchanged during this period.

in which X is conversion of 3-VNB and k is the rate constant. This indicates that the values of k can be determined by fitting the experimental data to Equation (1). Plotting the graph of lnk versus 1/T results in a straight line, as shown in Figure 3b. The apparent activation energy, Ea, for 3-VNB hydrogenation over the Au/Al2O3 catalyst (within the temperature range from 60 to 808C) estimated from the slope of the Arrhenius plot is about 64 kJmol�1.

In Table 3, we report on the results obtained when the Au/ Al2O3 catalyst was employed for the liquid-phase hydrogena- tion of 3-VNB under continuous-flow conditions. At tempera- tures as low as 608C (Table 3, entry 1), the conversion of 3-VNB reached approximately 57% with fairly good selectivity to the target product, 3-VAN, equal to 93.3%; the rest of the products were 3-VNSB and 3-EAN (Scheme 3). The TON value (at 608C),

the Au/Al2O3 catalyst, provides the possibility of restoring its activity in 3-VNB hydrogenation by burning-off surface carbo- naceous species at temperatures of approximately 4008C, which are sufficient for burning-off the main portion of these species, as observed in TPO experiments. For this purpose, the deactivated catalyst was heated in a fixed-bed Pyrex reactor with an air flow (500 h�1) to 4008C (ramping 48C min�1) and then maintained at this temperature for 2 h. Figure 4b demon- strates that such a treatment restores 3-VNB conversion over the gold catalyst at 808C, [3-VNB]inlet=0.05m, H2/3-VNB molar ratio of approximately 100, and t=0.67 s up to 93% (which is 94% of the initial X value), although the selectivity to 3-VAN re- mains at the same level as that before regeneration.

calculated as the amount of 3-VAN formed with time relative to the amount of catalyst (moles of Au), is 0.73 min�1. Increas- ing the temperature to 808C led to an increase in the 3-VNB conversion up to approximately 98%. Simultaneously, the share of 3-VNSB, which was not further hydrogenated into 3- VAN, decreased, whereas the yield of 3-EAN, which was the product of the hydrogenation of the vinyl group in 3-VAN, in- creased almost equally (Table 3, entries 2 and 3). As a result, the selectivity to 3-VAN remained practically unchanged with reaction temperature.

During all tests, the carbon balance between the inlet and outlet streams was within (95�2)%.

Each sample was stud- ied in the equipment for thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and DTA at the same time. The DTG curve of the fresh catalyst (Fig- ure 5a) exhibits a broad peak with a maximum at approxi- mately 958C, which is related, most likely, to removal of physi- cally adsorbed water (the loss of the sample weight in the 25– 2508C range was 2.5%). Additionally, a weight loss of 1% was observed in the 250–5008C range, probably owing to elimina-

ganic modifiers, allow success to be attained in certain cases. During the last decade, it was found that functionalized ani- lines could be obtained with very high selectivity by hydroge- nation of the corresponding nitroaromatic compounds over supported gold catalysts; these delivered lower reaction rates than those of palladium and platinum catalysts, but were much more chemoselective and did not require modifiers.[2,4–11]
