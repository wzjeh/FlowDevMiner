Therefore, the optimal NaNO2/NADA molar ratio is 1.05:1. 3.2.2. Optimization of Continuous Coupling Reaction Conditions. To determine the optimal conditions for the coupling reaction, the effects of temperature, pH of CTN (coupling component) solution, and total flow rate on dye purity were investigated. The reaction temperature significantly affects both the reaction rate and selectivity of the reactants. As shown in Figure 5a, increasing the reaction temperature from 5 to 20 °C accelerated the reaction and enhanced system flowability, resulting in higher dye purity within the same residence time. However, a further temperature rise signifi- cantly increases the hydrolysis of the dye and diazonium salt, causing a decrease in dye purity. Increasing the pH of the CTN solution from 7 to 10 also improved dye purity to approximately 90%, as the hydroxyl group of CTN was converted into oxyanion under alkaline conditions, thereby increasing the reactivity of the coupling site and the coupling reaction rate. However, a further increase in the pH led to reduced dye purity due to dye hydrolysis (Figure 5b). Finally, varying the total flow rate from 1000 to 2000 mL/min had little effect on dye purity, indicating effective mass and heat transfer in the dynamic tubular reactor (Figure 5c). As the total flow rate increased, the reaction times for each step decreased: the diazotization reaction time was reduced from 142 to 71 s, the oxidation−reduction step from 68 to 34 s, the coupling reaction from 77 to 39 s, and the overall residence time from 287 to 144 s (Figure 5d). In conclusion, the optimal conditions are as follows: TP = 20 °C, pH = 10, and Q = 2000 mL/min. 3.2.3. Comparison of Dye Performance by Different Synthesis Methods. After optimization, the productivity of C.I. Reactive Red 195 reached 736 kg/day, with a throughput of 120 L/h. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed a molecular ion peak at 511.5 ([M − 2H]2−/2), consistent with the molecular weight of C.I. Reactive Red 195 (Figure 6a). The infrared spectrum showed characteristic peaks consistent with C.I. Reactive Red 195, further confirming the compound structure (Figure 6b). In addition, liquid chromatography chromatograms for both commercial and continuously synthesized C.I. Reactive Red 195 displayed identical retention times for the main products (Figure 6c). Notably, the continuously synthesized C.I. Reactive Red 195 achieved approximately 25% higher purity than the commercial dye (Figure 6d). The two dyes were used to color cotton fabrics, and their color depth and color fastness were compared (Table 1). The

all raw material solutions): 12.5 mol of NADA was added to a 50 L stirring kettle, followed by water to the 25 L mark, and the mixture was stirred until dissolved. Finally, impurities were removed by filtration, and the concentration was determined via diazotization titration. 2.5. Experimental Procedure for Continuous Process. Details of the continuous flow experimental setup are provided in the Supporting Information section. The continuous flow synthesis process of C.I. Reactive Red 195 is illustrated in Figure 2. Before the reaction, the mechanical stirrer is activated first to ensure proper mixing of the reactants. The reaction temperature is then controlled by a high−low temperature circulating chiller to maintain the desired temperature throughout the process. The flow rates and start times of the pumps are controlled by a PLC control panel. Based on the preset start times, the pumps delivering NADA, hydrochloric acid, and sodium nitrite solutions are activated simultaneously to transport the three raw materials to the bottom of the tubular reactor. The raw materials flow upward through the reactor and undergo diazotization in the corresponding zone, producing diazonium salts. When the reactant mixture reaches "Inlet 4", the pump delivering a sulfamic acid solution is activated, directing it to the oxidation−reduction zone of the reactor, where excess nitrite is eliminated. Upon reaching "Inlet 5", the pump delivering the CTN solution is activated, transporting the solution to the coupling zone, where it mixes with diazonium salts and undergoes a coupling reaction to form the target dye. The product is then discharged from the top of the reactor into the storage tank for a 5 min delayed reaction to ensure complete conversion. Finally, the liquid dye is dried into powder by the spray dryer for subsequent processing and analysis. The dye purity is analyzed by HPLC at a wavelength of 254 nm using the peak area normalization method. 2.6. Dyeing Process. Cotton fibers were dyed using both the dyes synthesized in this study and commercial C.I. Reactive Red 195. The procedure was as follows: First, 2 g of cotton fibers and 0.04 g of C.I. Reactive Red 195 were added to a 40 mL aqueous solution. Subsequently, the samples were placed in an ECO DYER and dyed at room temperature for 30 min, with 2 g of sodium sulfate added every 15 min. The

3.1. Characterization of Mixing. The mixing perform- ance of the reactor is critical to the reaction outcome,43 as it directly impacts both the efficiency and selectivity. To evaluate the mixing efficiency, a competitive consecutive reaction system (Bourne reaction) was employed. As shown in Figure 3, with an increase in rotation speed, the segregation index

solvent's boiling point due to the open nature of the reaction system. TD0.05 represents the process temperature correspond- ing to TMRad of 0.05 h. With continuous flow, the residence time of the material in the dynamic tubular reactor does not exceed 0.05 h, indicating that uncontrolled reactions are unlikely to reach the maximum reaction rate at lower temperatures and shorter residence times. Therefore, TD0.05 is used instead of TD24 as the critical parameter for the safety assessment of the continuous diazotization process. The critical level for the NADA continuous diazotization process is determined to be level 1 based on (TP < MTSR < MTT < TD0.05), indicating low risk.

(XS) decreases, indicating better mixing performance. The minimum XS value is approximately 0.03, close to zero, indicating that the reactor provides nearly ideal mixing conditions, ensuring uniform distribution of reactants. Whether 1-naphthol is fed through Inlet 4 or Inlet 5, the mixing efficiency remains stable. This demonstrates that the material can be efficiently mixed regardless of the inlet used. Considering both energy consumption and reaction efficiency, a rotation speed of 100 rpm was selected as the optimal condition for the subsequent continuous synthesis of C.I. Reactive Red 195. 3.2. Optimization of Continuous Flow Reaction Conditions. In the multistep continuous flow synthesis of C.I. Reactive Red 195, the diazotization and coupling reactions are critical steps.44 Transitioning from batch production to continuous-flow processes requires comprehensive optimiza- tion of key reaction parameters, which focus primarily on the

molar ratio, temperature, pH, and total flow rate to ensure reaction efficiency and stable continuous-flow operation. 3.2.1. Optimization of Continuous Diazotization Reaction Conditions. Given the inherent acidity of NADA, it is essential to determine the optimal amount of hydrochloric acid for diazotization. As illustrated in Figure 4a, the yield of diazonium salts remains stable as the molar ratio (HCl/NADA) increases from 0 to 2.0, indicating that the acidity of the NADA raw materials is sufficient for the diazotization reaction, and additional acid is unnecessary. To investigate the effect of sodium nitrite dosage on the diazotization reaction, the molar ratio (NaNO2/NADA) was varied from 1 to 1.1. The yield of diazonium salts initially increased, peaking at a ratio of 1.05, then decreased (Figure 4b). This is because excess sodium nitrite may prevent the reaction between NADA and NADA- DS, while also promoting the progression of the diazotization reaction. However, too much sodium nitrite produces extra nitrous acid, leading to diazonium salt decomposition.45

where Qr is the total heat release of the diazotization reaction (J); Cp is the specific heat capacity of the reaction system (J/ (g·K)); and m is the total mass of the reaction system (g). In the case of cooling failure, the maximum temperature of the diazotization reaction (known as MTSR), is a critical parameter for the safety assessment of diazotization. MTSR is calculated using eq 9,53 and the results are presented in Table 3.

Probability of Uncontrolled NADA Diazotization. The TMRad was used to assess the probability of worst-case scenarios in uncontrolled reactions, defined as the time required for the reaction to reach its maximum rate under adiabatic conditions. The primary side reaction caused by thermal runaway during the diazotization reaction is NADA- DS thermal decomposition. For a more conservative approach, a zero-order reaction assumption was made, and eq 1055,56 was used to calculate TMRad. The calculation requires DSC data and the decomposition activation energy. The heat release rate

also known as the Diazo coupling reaction, has been widely used to characterize the mixing efficiency of various reactors.32−34 The specific reaction formula and details can be found in the Supporting Information. In this study, the reaction system was employed to assess the mixing efficiency in a dynamic tubular reactor, with the segregation index (XS) determined based on product concentration measurements. 2.4.

To evaluate the thermal hazards of continuous diazotization, a risk matrix combining ΔTad and TMRad classifies risk into acceptable, conditionally acceptable, and unacceptable risk.57 As shown in Table 2, the risk associated with continuous diazotization is classified as an acceptable risk.

of 8, 10, 12, and 15 °C/min. Each experiment was repeated at least three times for each condition. 2.11. Calorimetric Testing of Diazotization Reaction. The safety of the NADA diazotization process was evaluated using a reaction calorimeter. The reactant temperature was controlled isothermally using the EasyMax 402 HFCal system. Initially, 29.40 g (0.077 mol) of NADA and 135 g of deionized water were added to the reactor. The temperature was lowered to 5 °C with the stirring speed set to 300 rpm. Subsequently, 15.25 g of sodium nitrite solution (30 wt %) was rapidly added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min. After the reaction was completed, the temperature was gradually raised to room temperature. During the reaction, parameters including reactor temperature (Tr), jacket temperature (Tj), stirring rate (R), and heat release rate (qr) were recorded. The heat release of the diazotization (ΔHr) was calculated by integrating qr, with the baseline determined by the line connecting the initial and final points of the reaction curve.

process remains absent, which is essential for improving the C.I. Reactive Red 195 production and ensuring safety. Unlike traditional batch operations, continuous flow technology offers several advantages, including high mass and heat transfer efficiency, stable product quality, and a compact footprint.22−24 Recently, researchers have conducted continu- ous coupling reactions in a microreactor, using preprepared diazonium salts and coupling components, to synthesize water- insoluble azo dyes or pigments, such as Pigment Yellow 12,25,26

Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) was conducted using the Psi4 program41 at the sSAPT0/jun-cc-pVDZ level of theory. AIMD simulations were conducted using the xtb software at the GFN1-xTB level with the ALPB implicit solvation model.42 The simulations were conducted for 100 ps in the NVT ensemble at T = 298.15 K with a time step of 2 fs and temperature controlled by the Berendsen thermostat. 2.9. DSC Measurement of NADA-DS. DSC was used to preliminarily assess the thermal hazards of the reactant species, providing a basis for subsequent research. The heat of reaction for the decomposition of approximately 2 mg of NADA-DS was measured in a closed crucible at a ramp rate of 2 °C/min from 25 to 250 °C with an N2 purge. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. 2.10. TGA Measurement of NADA-DS. TGA was used to assess the thermal stability of NADA-DS.
