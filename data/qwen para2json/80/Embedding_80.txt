The reactions were carried out with various flow rates to control the residence time at 100 °C (Figure 9). When a single monolith A reactor was used, the yield of biphenyl-4-carbonitrile was significantly influenced by the flow rate (Table 2, n = 1). The increase in the residence time by decreasing the flow rate caused an increase in the yield. The use of a single monolith B reactor also led to a similar result. Because of the larger pore size, the pressure drop for the monolith B reactor was much lower than that of the monolith A reactor. The product was obtained in a quantitative yield with the flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, although the increase in the flow rate caused a decrease in the yield, presumably because a shorter residence time leads to an incomplete conversion of the substrate. Next, the reactions were carried out using multiple monolith B reactors connected in series (Table 2, n = 3 and 5). The use of multiple reactors connected in series often caused a higher pressure drop, which might be an obstacle for practical continuous production. However, the pressure drop was acceptable in this case because of larger pore size of monolith B. Notably, by using three reactors

The operation of integrated systems consisting of multiple monolithic reactors in series at higher flow rates suffers from a high pressure drop. To solve this problem, a polymer monolith (monolith B) with wider pore sizes was synthesized by changing reaction temperatures when prepared (monolith A for temperature at 100 ◦C and monolith B for temperature at 85 ◦C) (vide supra). Generally, the pressure drop depends on the pore size. In fact, the pressure drop of monolith A of a smaller pore size was larger than that of monolith B of a larger pore size. For example, the operation using a monolith A reactor at 60 ◦C with the flow rate of 1.5 mL/min led to 8.2 Pa, whereas that using a monolith B reactor lead to 0.8 Pa. Before studying the series connection of the reactors, the reaction using a single monolith B reactor was examined. To a solution of lithium trimethoxy(phenyl)borate prepared by the flow method (Figure 3) was added a solution of p-iodobenzonitrile (0.033 M in MeOH), and the mixture was passed through a reactor containing a Pd catalyst supported by monolith B using a plunger pump (Figure 5). The reactions were carried out with various residence times (tR) at various temperatures (T). As profiled in Figure 7, the yield of biphenyl-4-carbonitrile was significantly influenced by both T and tR. At 100 ◦C, the yield increased with an increase in tR, and the reaction was complete within a few minutes.

However, the pressure drop was acceptable in this case because of larger pore size of monolith B. Notably, by using three reactors connected in series, the product was obtained in a quantitative yield with a flow rate three times larger than that for a single reactor (1.2 mL/min). Therefore, the productivity can be three times higher than that for a single reactor. Similarly, by using five reactors connected in series, the product was obtained in a quantitative yield with a flow rate five times larger than that for a single reactor (2.0 mL/min). Therefore, the productivity was five times larger than that for a single reactor. The increase in the flow rate caused a decrease in the yield because of an incomplete conversion.

[126–130] (Figure 8b). However, the method often suffers from a poor uniformity in fluid distribution [131,132]. Therefore, various types of flow distributors such as manifold[133,134], bifurcation-, and split-and-recombine-type flow distributors have been developed to improve the uniformity of the fluid distribution. We envisaged that the numbering-up method with a series connection of the flow reactors [135] could serve as a method for increasing productivity (Figure 8c). The residence time can be kept constant by a series connection of the reactors even with higher flow rates. A major obstacle of this approach is, however, the increase in the pressure drop with an increase in the number of the reactors in the series. The use of the monolith B reactor solved the problem. Their use in series enabled operation at high flow rates with a low pressure drop.

into appropriate lengths (3.5, 25, 50, 100, and 300 cm). The micromixers and microtube reactors were connected with stainless steel fittings (GL Sciences, 1/16 OUW) to construct the flow microreactor systems. The flow microreactor system was dipped in the bath to control the temperature. The solutions were continuously introduced to the flow microreactor system using syringe pumps, Harvard PHD 2000, equipped with gastight syringes purchased from SGE or a plunger pump, shimadzu LC-20AT (Tokyo, Japan).

A flow microreactor system consisting of two T-shaped micromixers (M1 and M2), two microtube reactors (R1 and R2), and three tube precooling units (P1 (inner diameter φ = 1000 µm, length L = 100 cm), P2 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 50 cm), and P3 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 100 cm)) was used for the formation of lithium borate. A solution of bromobenzene (0.10 M in THF) (flow rate: 6.0 mL/min) and a solution of n-BuLi (0.60 M in hexane) (flow rate: 1.0 mL/min) were introduced to M1 (φ = 500 µm) at 0 ◦C by syringe pumps. The resulting solution was passed through R1 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 25 cm (tR1 = 1.7 s)) and was mixed with a solution of trimethoxyborane (0.12 M in THF) (flow rate: 5.0 mL/min) in M2 (φ = 500 µm) (0 ◦C). The resulting solution was passed through R2 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 50 cm (tR2 = 2.0 s)) (0 ◦C). The resulting solution was collected in a vessel. Then, a solution of p-iodobenzonitrile (0.033 M in MeOH (0.67 eq)) was added, and the resulting solution was passed through a flow reactor packed with a Pd catalyst supported by monolith A or monolith B at T ◦C by using a plunger pump. The reaction was carried out with various residence times (tR) by changing the flow rates at various temperatures (T). After a steady state was reached, the product solution was collected (10 min). The reaction mixture was analyzed by GC, and the results are summarized in Tables 5 and 6.

In general, the productivity can be increased by increasing the flow rate in a single flow reactor (Figure 8a). However, the increase in the flow rate often causes a decrease in the conversion because the residence time in the reactor becomes shorter. Therefore, the numbering-up method with a parallel connection of the flow reactors serves as a common approach to improve the productivity

solution of n-BuLi (0.60 M in hexane) (flow rate: 1.0 mL/min) were introduced to M1 (φ = 250 µm) by syringe pumps. The resulting solution was passed through R1 (1.7 s (φ = 1000 µm, L = 25 cm) or 0.059 s (φ = 500 µm, L = 3.5 cm)) and was mixed with a solution of trimethoxyborane (0.12 M in THF) (flow rate: 5.0 mL/min) in M2 (φ = 250 µm). The resulting solution was passed through R2 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 50 cm (tR2 = 2.0 s)) (for the case of 2,2′-dibromobiphenyl, R2 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 300 cm (tR2 = 11.8 s)) was used). The resulting solution was collected in a vessel. Then, a solution of arylhalides (Ar2–X) (0.033 M in MeOH (0.67 eq)) was added, and the resulting solution was passed through a flow reactor packed with a polymer monolith A containing immobilized Pd by a plunger pump (condition (a): tR = 4.7 min, T = 100 ◦C or condition (b): tR = 9.4 min, T = 120 ◦C). After a steady state was reached, the product solution was collected (10 min) (for the case of 2,2′-dibromobiphenyl, 100 min). The yield of product was determined by GC analysis or isolation. The results are summarized in Table 1.

Recently the chemical synthesis using continuous flow reactors has received significant research interests from both academia and the industry [1–47]. Because of better heat and mass transfer and a shorter residence time, flow processes offer various benefits over conventional batch processes, including increased controllability, safety, and selectivity. A number of synthetic transformations that are difficult or impossible for conventional batch processes have been developed using flow processes [48–58]. Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions [59–64], in particular, using heterogeneous catalysts [65–69], serve as a powerful method for the chemical production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and several examples of the flow process using supported palladium catalysts [70–87] including the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of arylboronic acids and aryl halides [88–91] have been reported. Although some arylboronic acids are commercially available, it is often necessary to prepare appropriate arylboronic acids for a desired transformation [92–99], and the preparation of arylbornonic acids often suffers from difficulties in the purification processes [100–105]. Therefore, the integration

Abstract: The space integration of the lithiation of aryl halides, the borylation of aryllithiums, and Suzuki–Miyaura coupling using a Pd catalyst supported by a polymer monolith flow reactor without using an intentionally added base was achieved. To scale up the process, a series connection of the monolith Pd reactor was examined. To suppress the increase in the pressure drop caused by the series connection, a monolith reactor having larger pore sizes was developed by varying the temperature of the monolith preparation. The monolithic Pd reactor having larger pore sizes enabled Suzuki–Miyaura coupling at a higher flow rate because of a lower pressure drop and, therefore, an increase in productivity. The present study indicates that series connection of the reactors with a higher flow rate serves as a good method for increasing the productivity without decreasing the yields.

Synthesized in 54% yield (condition (b)) (isolated yield). After the extraction with EtOAc, the crude product was thoroughly washed with hexane and water to give the product as a white solid (59.8 mg); 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.77–7.70 (m, 4H), 7.68 (s, 4H), 7.60 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), and 7.51 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H). The spectral data were identical to those reported in the literature [145].

Prior to studying the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling, we studied the preparation of lithium arylborates by the lithiation of aryl halides followed by the borylation of aryllithiums [113]. The reactions were carried out using a flow microreactor system consisting of two T-shaped micromixers (M1 and M2) and two microtube reactors (R1 and R2) (Figure 1). For example, a solution of bromobenzene (0.10 M in THF, 6.0 mL/min) and a solution of n-BuLi (0.60 M in hexane, 1.0 mL/min) were introduced to M1 (φ = 500 µm) at 0 ◦C by syringe pumps. The resulting solution was passed through R1 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 25 cm (tR1 = 1.7 s)) and was mixed with a solution of trimethoxyborane (0.12 M in THF, 5.0 mL/min) in M2 (φ = 500 µm). The resulting solution was then passed through R2 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 50 cm (tR2 = 2.0 s)). A cloudy mixture was obtained, presumably because of an insufficient solubility of the resulting lithium arylborate (Figure 2a). Various solvents including THF, methanol, and ethanol were examined to solubilize the lithium arylborate, and a clear solution was obtained when methanol was added (Figure 2b).

The mixing solution of phenyllithium (0.050 M in Et2O/THF = 1:19 (1.00 eq)), trimethoxyborane (0.050 M in Et2O/THF = 1:19 (1.00 eq)), and p-cyanoiodobenzene (0.033 M in MeOH (0.67 eq)) was passed through a flow reactor packed with a Pd catalyst supported by monolith A or monolith B by using a plunger pump (120 ◦C, 0.20 mL/min). After a steady state was reached, the product solution was collected (10 min). Then, the monolithic reactor was washed with THF (30 mL). Fifteen cycles of reactions and washings were carried out in the same way. The yields of the product were determined by a GC analysis. The results were summarized in Table 4.
