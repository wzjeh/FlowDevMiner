part of the microreactor. A symmetric concentration profile is evident along reactor height because the reaction is taking place on the catalyst on both sides of the microchannel. In the precatalytic region (-L′ e z e 0), a slow decrease in reactant concentration is already observed, resulting from the previously discussed back- mixing in the reactor. The use of Pd/Fe catalyst in the microreactor yielded phenol as the only product of p-chlorophenol dechlori- nation. The ambient-temperature experiments were performed at flow rates from 0.09 to 0.63 mL/min, resulting in Reynolds numbers between 0.12 and 0.77, based on the average axial velocity vav, equilibrium length de, fluid density F, and viscosity µ. This is in agreement with the laminar flow condition applied in the development of the mathematical model. As seen in Figure 7, the model accurately predicts the conversion of p-chlorophenol at different flow rates and yields the corresponding overall rate constant k293 K / ) 1.04 × 10-7 m/s. Considering the catalyst dimensions, calcula- tion of the rate constant gives k293 K ) 1.97 × 10-5 m3/ kgcat‚s, which is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the

for the CSTR. Both contain the characteristic dimen- sionless group k*L/vavB as an independent parameter for reactor efficiency. Figure 5 compares the predictions for the ideal PFR and CSTR models with our model simulations for different Peclet numbers (0.01 e Pe e 10) and shows the results obtained in the experiments. Generally, an increase in the flow rate results in an increase in Pe, and consequently, our model for the microreactor approaches that for a PFR. At Pe ) 10, the model gives close-to-ideal PFR performance, and a further increase in Peclet number results in the com- plete overlapping of the model simulations with the PFR curve, so the results are not presented. As the experi- mental Pe values (based on average axial velocity vav, reactor half-height B, and the molecular diffusivity DAB) were between 17.5 and 223.5 for the whole set of experiments, the results of the model simulations completely match those of the PFR. Similar findings were recently reported by Deshmukh et.al.,25 who compared a 2D computational fluid dynamic simulation of a complex structured post microreactor with various reactor models. For a wide range of temperatures and flow rates, nearly PFR behavior was observed in the model simulations of a microstructured reactor used for hydrogen production from ammonia. Only in the case of very low velocities, expressed as Pe values below 1, does the microreactor shift away from PFR behavior, and at very low values of k*L/vavB, it performs even worse than a CSTR (Figure 5). This phenomenon might be explained by pronounced back- mixing present at slower flows, not taken into account in the PFR model. In the case of very slow reaction kinetics, this results in lower conversions as compared to those obtained at higher flow rates, where the back- mixing from longitudinal diffusion is diminished. Figure 6 presents results of a 2D model simulation of the dimensionless concentration profile in the first

Using a wide range of theoretical operating condi- tions, a dimensionless concentration was calculated for the plug-flow reactor (PFR) model, the continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model, and our 2D model. The steady-state mass balance of p-chlorophenol dechlo- rination is given by

For the numerical solution of the model equations, a finite-difference method was used. Regarding a wide range of theoretical operating conditions, varying nodal densities of meshes were applied. To achieve stability of the system at high Peclet number, Pe, the micro- reactor was divided into several parts along the reactor length, where each outlet profile served as the input for the next section. On the contrary, at Pe values below 0.1, where a lower nodal density is sufficiently accurate, the whole microreactor was treated as a unit. Using the implicit approach, matrices up to 105 × 105 were solved using the Mathematica 5.0 computational tool. To describe the deactivation process observed in experimental studies, the activity term a was added to the reaction rate equation, which accounts for the passivation effects, as presented in Figure 2

amples, reviewed by Ja¨hnisch et al.,14 indicate a 10% to severalfold increase of reaction yield when compared to conventional reactor processes. Recently, the first study of an enzymatic reaction in two-phase flow in a microfluidic device was reported by Maruyama et al.,22 where degradation of p-chlorophenol was realized by solubilized laccase. In our study, the use of a microreactor for the degradation of p-chlorophenol on bimetallic Pd/Fe cata- lyst is presented, which has a potential use in on-site pollutant remediation. The goal of the study is to obtain the dechlorination of p-chlorophenol in a continuous- flow microreactor made of two iron plates palladized by electroless deposition of Pd on the reactor plate surfaces. A mathematical model is developed to describe and predict reactor performance at steady-state conditions. Microreactor simulations are compared with ideal plug- flow reactor (PFR) and continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) models for a broad range of operating conditions. Furthermore, the deactivation of catalyst that resulted in unsteady-state operation is described by a dynamic model. Finally, an estimate of the activation energy for this reaction is obtained.

For dechlorination in a microreactor with laminar fluid flow, a two-dimensional (2D) model is developed. Both longitudinal and transverse diffusion and convec- tion in the longitudinal direction are considered, with an irreversible, pseudo-first-order reaction at the cata- lyst surfaces on both sides of the flow channel. For an accurate description of the effects of back-mixing at the inlet of the catalytic area (z ) 0), the precatalytic zone is considered, as shown in Figure 4. In this zone, which represents a defined portion of the system (L′ is ap- proximately 0.1L), the boundary conditions without chemical reaction are taken into account. For steady-state conditions in the single-pass mi- croreactor system before catalyst deactivation, the dimensionless partial differential equation is

Dechlorination of p-chlorophenol was investigated in a single-pass, continuous-flow microreactor system made of two parallel palladized iron plates. The plates formed a microscale channel 27 mm wide, 70 mm long, and 0.2 mm high. The bimetallic catalyst was prepared by electroless deposition of Pd on the reactor plate surfaces. Experiments were performed under steady-state conditions at different temperatures between 293 and 333 K and at a variety of flow conditions in the range from 1.5 × 10-9 to 1 × 10-8 m3/s. A two-dimensional mathematical model, containing convection, diffusion, and pseudo-first-order catalytic reaction terms, was developed to analyze the experimental data and to forecast reactor performance. Depending on the prevailing kinetic and convection/diffusion phenomena, the developed model can be reduced to the ideal plug-flow model or can depict reactor performance that is close to or even worse than the performance of an ideal mixed-flow reactor. Under operating conditions typical to this study, the model and the experimental data indicate plug-flow behavior of the microreactor. Analysis of the obtained chemical kinetic rate constants provides an estimate of the activation energy for this reaction (Ea ) 48.43 ( 6.13 kJ/mol), which remains unchanged despite observed deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivation of the catalyst is caused by reversible catalyst passivity, and it is modeled by second-order kinetics. Analysis of the experimental data shows that the observed deactivation influences only the preexponential factor in the Arrhenius law for the investigated reaction.

constant reported for granular Pd/Fe catalyst at the same temperature (k293 K ) 6.52 × 10-2 m3/kgcat‚s).6 Another study of p-chlorophenol dechlorination with powdered Pd/Fe catalyst at 301 K5 revealed a constant of k301 K ) 3.90 × 10-4 m3/kgcat‚s, and the dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and trichloroethene (TCE) with nanoscale Pd/Fe catalyst10 yielded k295 K ) 9.3 × 10-4 m3/kgcat‚s, which is more similar to our results. The discrepancies in reaction rates are most likely a consequence of the different catalyst sizes and structures. This was also suggested by Zhang et al.,12 who reported average rate constants for the degradation of trans-dichloroethene (trans-DCE) varying between k295 K ) 9.3 × 10-5 m3/kgcat‚s for nanoscale Pd/Fe particles and k295 K ) 9.3 × 10-7 m3/kgcat‚s for microscale iron particles. The comparison of reaction rate constants is summarized in Table 1. From Figure 7, it is evident also that an increase in flow rate, and therefore a decrease in contact time, lowers the conversion of p-chlorophenol on Pd/Fe catalyst. Moreover, the effect of temperature on the dechlori- nation kinetics was studied at temperatures between 293 and 333 K. As expected, the rate of dechlorination increased at higher temperature to achieve k333 K / ) 1.21 × 10-6 m/s at 333 K, and the conversions obtained in a single pass at this temperature reached over 90%. However, in most cases, an increase in the relative p-chlorophenol concentration is observed after a few hours of the steady-state process (this time is defined as ts and varied among experiments), indicating a deactivation of the Pd/Fe catalyst. This phenomenon might be a consequence of several factors: pH changes in the reactor; iron hydroxide deposits on the surface of the catalyst; the loss of catalyst base through dissolution of Fe; and even catalyst flaking, which was noticed at higher temperatures. The changes in the catalyst sur- face at the end of the experiment, as compared to freshly prepared Pd/Fe catalyst, are evident in Figure 8. Modeling of the observed deactivation was approached by applying the reaction kinetics with an activity term (eqs 11 and 12) to the dynamic model for a PFR. For the experimental data after the end of the steady-state

were immersed in 1 M HCl to remove any foreign metals that might have been picked up during mechanical preparation and to remove surface oxide layers. After a thorough rinsing of the plates with deionized water, two iron plates were attached to a polypropylene mounting disk. The electroless plating of Pd was per- formed by immersion in a disk-coating bath with a solution of 1 mM PdCl2 and 0.1 M HCl, and the disk was rotated at 300 rpm unless the dark orange PdCl2 solution turned colorless. The procedure was always performed under exactly the same conditions to ensure the deposition of the same amount of Pd and to achieve the same surface quality on each plate. After the palladization, the iron plates were rinsed with deionized water and kept for later use without drying. Apparatus and Experimental Procedure. The experimental apparatus for steady-state dechlorination is shown in Figure 3. A pair of palladized iron plates attached to polypropylene disks was used in the mi- croreactor, which was housed in a stainless steel casing, 0.152 m in diameter and 0.019 m thick, with an empty reactor volume of 1.2 mL. The space between the plates (maximum depth of 200 ( 1.02 µm) acted as a flow channel. A Pd catalyst loading of 20 mg (10 mg per plate) was used to dechlorinate p-chlorophenol, which was prepared as a 100 ppm (7.8 × 10-7 mol/m3) aqueous solution and sparged with pure N2 to remove dissolved oxygen. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.3 by HCl addition. The reactant solution was pumped through a tightly closed reactor by a positive-displacement pump in downstream configuration at a constant flow rate in the range from 0.09 to 0.63 ((0.002) mL/min. The mean residence time of fluid in the reactor was between 2 and 12 min over the operating range of flow rates used. All tubing was made of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), and nylon was used for all fittings. The reactor was first placed in a vertical position to eliminate the formation of gas pockets, which might cause the presence of air bubbles in the samples. The experiments were con- ducted for 24 h at temperatures in a range between 293 and 333 K, where the temperatures of both the inlet line and the reactor itself were kept constant. Analyses. The amount of deposited Pd catalyst was calculated from the concentrations of the PdCl2 solution, estimated spectrophotometrically at 480 nm, before and after electroless plating. An Amray 3300FE scanning electron microscope was used to produce micrographs of the Pd/Fe catalyst surface. The concentrations of p-chlorophenol and phenol were assayed using HPLC with a 5-µ, LC-8 column (Supelco). Elution was obtained with a mobile phase consisting of 60 vol % acetic acid/methanol solution (1:99 vol %) and 40 vol % acetic acid/deionized water solution (1:99 vol %) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Absorbance detection was at 254 nm, and the p-chlorophenol and phenol concentrations were determined from calibration curves obtained with standard solutions.

calculation of overall reaction rate constants. Compari- son of the model simulations with ideal reactor predic- tions effectively shows PFR behavior at the operating conditions applied in the experiments. The experimental results indicate moderate efficiency of the catalytic reaction in a microreactor system at room temperature. Increased temperatures resulted in higher conversions and overall reaction rate constants, although they are up to 3 orders of magnitude lower than those reported for granular and nanoscale Pd/Fe catalyst. Moreover, the deactivation of the catalyst was observed after a few hours of steady-state continuous processing and was described as a second-order process. Passivation of the catalyst resulted in a lower Arrhenius preexponential factor for the dechlorination process compared to the initial rates. The application of recent advances in microfabrication techniques for catalytic reactors would probably ensure a more stable catalyst and therefore diminish undesirable deactivation.
