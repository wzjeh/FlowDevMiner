A flow-type microreactor containing composite materials of a theanine synthetase (glutaminase) and

mesoporous silica with 23.6 nm pore diameter (SBA-15 microsphere) was developed for the continuous

synthesis of L-theanine, a unique amino acid. Enzyme-immobilisation ability and enzymatic activity in the

SBA-15 microsphere with large mesopores were higher than those of SBA-15 with a 5.4 nm pore diameter. Moreover, the glutaminase–SBA-15 microsphere composites displayed higher selectivity in

theanine production than the free enzyme did in a batch experiment. A direct visualization of

composites of fluorescently labelled glutaminase and SBA-15 microsphere immobilised in the flow

channel of the microreactor by a combination of diﬀerential interference contrast and fluorescence

microscopy revealed that the enzymes were uniformly dispersed throughout the mesoporous silica

particles, because of the successful encapsulation of the enzyme. The enzyme-encapsulated

microreactor exhibited a high conversion of L-glutamine to L-theanine with local control of the reaction

temperature. In addition to this advantage of the microreaction system, the microreactor enabled the on-oﬀ regulation of enzymatic activity during continuous theanine synthesis by controlling the reaction

Despite the remarkable progress in enzyme immobilisation techniques, which rely on chemical cross-linking, physical adsorption, or specic aﬃnity bonding, current techniques can occasionally cause severe damage to the enzymes, e.g., by blocking their active centres, inducing conformational changes,8 or forming aggregates. Although there are several specic enzyme immobilisation techniques using aﬃnity bonds, such as those in the biotin–avidin system and the His- tag technique,9,10 which is based on the construction of a self- assembled monolayer (SAM) of bifunctional linkers, these techniques are still very expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, a new enzyme immobilisation technique that (a) does not cause inactivation of the enzyme, (b) performs a stable, continuous reaction to yield the desired product, and (c) is relatively cost-eﬃcient, is desired. In order to achieve this goal, we have developed an enzyme- encapsulated microreactor containing immobilised meso- porous silica capsules that have a hexagonally ordered pore structure,11–13 which acts as an encapsulation material for delivery of proteins14 and for enzymes, which is known to increase their stability and durability when exposed to heat,15,16

The development of microscale reaction technologies, such as microreactors, for use in the elds of enzyme and biological engineering has recently attracted considerable attention because of the many potential industrial applications for these technologies.1,2 The advantage of using a puried, immobilised enzyme-based microreactor for biocatalytic reactions over using macro scale systems with immobilised cells is that the enzyme- immobilised microreactor facilitates the precise control of the reaction temperature to increase the reaction eﬃciency and reduce the reaction time.3–6 The selective and stable but reversible immobilisation of an enzyme on a solid support provides a reusable, continuous reaction system and oﬀers a promising approach for use in industrial production processes.7

Pore-size optimisation is

synthesized from TEOS by using Pluronic P123 and mesitylene, as follows. To 120 mL of water was added 4 g of Pluronic P123, followed by 6.1 g of KCl; this mixture was stirred until trans- lucent at room temperature. Then, 23.6 g of 12 N HCl and 3 g of mesitylene were added to the above solution. This mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Aer adding 8.5 g of TEOS to the above solution, the mixture was vigorously stirred for 10 min at room temperature, and aged for 24 h at 35 �C, and subsequently aged for another 24 h at 130 �C. Next, the above solid products were ltered out, washed 3 times with 400 mL of distilled water at 80 �C, and dried at 45 �C. The samples were calcined in air at a heating rate of 105 �C h�1

vital for the appropriate expression of enzymatic activity in a microreactor containing composites of enzyme and meso- porous silica material. Thus, the eﬀect of pore diameter on the adsorption capacity of silica and its reactivity toward enzymes must be claried. To this end, we here rst investigated the ability of 2 types of SBA-15 series of mesoporous silica (SBA5.4 and SBA23.6; pore diameters of 5.4 and 23.6 nm, respectively) to encapsulate a recombinant glutaminase (theanine synthetase) and the resulting enzymatic activity in the synthesis of a unique amino acid found in tea, viz., g-glutamylethylamide (L-theanine), in batch experiments. Then, we conducted investigations of the on-chip encapsulation of glutaminase using the SBA-15 parti- cles immobilised in a ow-type microreactor. We also conrmed the specic immobilisation of glutaminase on the SBA-15 particles in the microow channel by direct visualiza- tion of the immobilised glutaminase using optical microscopy, and subsequently evaluated the performance of the enzyme microreactor in the continuous synthesis of L-theanine.

In order to evaluate the pore diameters, pore volumes, and specic surface areas of the calcined mesoporous silicas, nitrogen adsorption and desorption measurements were carried out at �196 �C on BELSORP-max gas adsorption apparatus (BEL Japan Inc., Osaka, Japan). The pore-size distributions were determined by analysing the adsorption branch via the Barrett– Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.28 The specic surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method,29

Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), as a silica source for meso- porous silicas, was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Indus- tries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Triblock copolymer, poly(ethyleneglycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly- (ethyleneglycol) with the composition EO20PO70EO20 (pluronic P123; Mw ¼ 5800, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was used as a surfactant template. For use as a swelling agent, 1,3,5-trime- thylbenzene (mesitylene) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.

using adsorption data ranging from P/P0 ¼ 0.05 to 0.25. To conrm the morphology of the mesoporous silica parti- cles, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations were carried out as follows. Scanning electron micrographs of the 2 mesoporous silicas (SBA5.4 and SBA23.6) were obtained using a Miniscope (TM-1000; Hitachi High-Technologies Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV.

In this study, N-terminal hexa-histidine-tagged g-glutamyl- transpeptidase (i.e., glutaminase) from Pseudomonas nitro- reducens IFO12694 was overexpressed using BL21 Star Escherichia coli cells; subsequently, the puried enzyme was used for encapsulation in mesoporous silicas and the microow reaction experiment. The entire coding sequence of glutaminase was cloned into the vector pET302NT-His for expression in E. coli. The plasmid was introduced into E. coli. strain BL21 Star (DE3), and the bacterial cell was grown from a single colony overnight at 37 �C in 50 mL of LB broth (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 0.1 mg mL�1

A complete glutaminase gene derived from Pseudomonas nitro- reducens IFO12694, which consists of 1671 bp and encodes an enzyme of 557 amino acids,25 was obtained as a synthetic gene from Life Technologies Corp. (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The vector pET302NT-His (Life Technologies Corp.) was used to clone the glutaminase gene. E. coli. strain BL21 Star (DE3) (Life Tech- nologies Corp.) was used as the bacterial strain for expression of enzyme.

ampicillin. Aer transferring to 2000 mL of Turbo Broth (Athena Enzyme Systems, Baltimore, MD, USA), containing 0.1 mg mL�1 ampicillin, and growth for 3 h at 30 �C, the cells were cultured with isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside at a nal concentration of 1 mM for 4 h at 30 �C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7810 � g for 5 min at 4 �C, and the pellet was washed with 400 mL of cell wash buﬀer (20 mM Tris (2- amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol [H2NC(CH2OH)3])– HCl buﬀer [pH 7.5] and 500 mM NaCl), and resuspended in 400 mL of cell lysis buﬀer (10 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris–HCl buﬀer [pH 7.5], containing 0.05 mg mL�1 lysozyme, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl uoride, 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM b- mercaptoethanol), and sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged at

As the mesoporous silica capsules for the glutaminase, we prepared 2 types of SBA-15: SBA5.4 and SBA23.6, with pore diameters of 5.4 and 23.6 nm, respectively. SBA5.4 was synthesized from TEOS by using Pluronic P123,26

as follows. In a typical synthesis, 10 g of the Pluronic P123 was dissolved in 300 mL of water, and the resultant mixture was stirred overnight at 35 �C. Then, 21.9 g of 12 N HCl and 21.3 g of TEOS were added to the above solution. This mixture was stir- red for 20 h at 35 �C. Aer stirring, the mixture was aged for 24 h at 35 �C. SBA23.6 was prepared according to the method reported by Wang et al.,27 with some modications. SBA23.6 was

7810 � g for 20 min at 4 �C. The supernatant containing over- expressed enzyme was ltrated by a lter membrane with a 0.45 mm pore size and loaded into 2 mL Ni sepharose 6 fast ow resin (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England) packed in a chromatography column. Aer loading the sample in 8 columns, the expressed enzyme was washed with wash buﬀer (20 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.5], 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol), and eluted with elution buﬀer (500 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.5], 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol). Subsequently, the sample was dialyzed with dialysis buﬀer (50 mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.5], 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 15% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40, and 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol), and inspissated by concentrating column. The puried enzyme concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method, with bovine serum albumin as a standard; the purity of the enzyme was then evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

See also Fig. S1 (ESI†) for a detailed build process of the microreactor and a characterisation of the microflow channel.

A batch adsorption experiment was performed by combining 5 mg of the mesoporous silica powder (SBA5.4 or SBA23.6) with 0.5 mL of 100 mM ethylamine hydrochloride solution (pH 5.5) containing an appropriate amount of glutaminase (0.05–2.7 mg). The glutaminase–SBA mixtures suspended in the solution were gently shaken using a rotator for 17 h at 4 �C. The glutaminase– SBA composites were then centrifuged for 5 min at 15 300 � g and the supernatant was recovered. In order to establish the amount of glutaminase adsorbed to the SBAs, the enzyme concentration of the rst supernatant was determined spectro- photometrically by the BCA method, aer which the amount of glutaminase adsorbed on the SBAs was determined by subtract- ing the concentration of the glutaminase remaining in the supernatant from that of the glutaminase before the immobilisation. For the evaluation of enzymatic activity in the glutaminase– SBA composites in the batch experiment, the composite was rinsed twice with the above ethylamine hydrochloride solution and then resuspended in an appropriate volume of the solution so that the nal concentration of the immobilised enzyme was 0.5 mg mL�1.

Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as adhesive and then sprinkled with calcined SBA powder. It was then heated for 3 h at 85 �C. The SBA particles were then immobilised onto the surface by poly- merization of a PDMS prepolymer layer (thickness: 0.1 mm); as a result, the nal depth of the ow channel was about 0.1 mm (inner volume: ca. 130 mL). Likewise, the SBA particles were immobilised on the ow channel (width: 5 mm, length: 250 mm, depth: 0.1 mm) ditched in a PDMS membrane (width: 50 mm, length: 75 mm, thickness: 1 mm) by polymerization of a PDMS prepolymer layer (thickness: 0.1 mm), resulting in a depthless ow channel. The SBA particle-immobilised surfaces of the glass channel and PDMS membrane were air-dried to remove any unattached SBA, aer which the lower ow channel was sealed with the upper PDMS membrane. The ow channel was tted with 2 microtubes for supplying solution. Recombinant glutaminase was encapsulated in the pores of the SBA-15 immobilised in the microreactor by adding 1 mL of 100 mM ethylamine hydrochloride solution (pH 5.5) containing 0.2 mg mL�1 glutaminase into the ow channel at 10 mL min�1

Preparation of a microreactor containing glutaminase–SBA composites

The proposed design of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/glass microreactor containing the glutaminase–mesoporous silica (SBA-15) composite particles is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The SBA particles were immobilised over the entire surface of both sides of the slit in the microreactor, that is, the top and bottom of the ow channel, as follows. A glass substrate (width: 52 mm, length: 76 mm, thickness: 1 mm; Matsunami Glass Ind., Ltd, Osaka, Japan) was used as the base material to fabricate the ow channel of the microreactor. To immobilise SBA particles, the glass surface of the ow channel (Fig. 1a; width: 5 mm, length: 250 mm, depth: 0.2 mm), fabricated by etching the glass substrate, was coated with a thin layer of liquid PDMS prepolymer (SILPOT 184; Dow Corning Toray Co.,

at 4 �C using a syringe pump (Model 11 plus; Harvard Appa- ratus, Holliston, MA, USA). The obtained glutaminase–SBA composites immobilised in the reactor were then rinsed with 1 mL of above ethylamine hydrochloride solution at 20 mL min�1.

To allow determination of the amount of glutaminase adsorbed onto the SBA particles, the enzyme was chemically modied with a thiol-reactive uorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 488 C5-maleimide, C30H25N4NaO12S2; Mr 720.66; lmax abs /lmax em ¼ 493 nm/516 nm; Life Technologies Corp.) at the thiol group

position on the enzyme, with a degree of labelling of approximately 1 dye molecule to 1 enzyme molecule.13 Aer preparing the uorescently labelled enzyme, the enzyme was immobilised in the SBA-xed microreactor by the above- mentioned encapsulating and washing procedure. Then, the amount of glutaminase immobilised in each microreactor was estimated from standard curves of uorescence intensi- ties of Alexa 488 dye in the dye-labelled glutaminase–SBA composites (0.003–3 mg glutaminase) using a uorescence- image analyser (FLA-5100; FUJIFILM Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Evaluation of the encapsulation of the enzyme in SBA particles immobilised in the microreactor was also carried out by direct visualization using a uorescence microscopy tech- nique. The existence and relative localization of the enzyme encapsulated in the pores could be monitored by detecting the uorescently labelled version of the enzyme.26,30 The gluta- minase–SBA composites immobilised in the microreactor were observed by a combination of diﬀerential interference contrast (DIC) and uorescence microscopy using an inverted micro- scope (ECLIPSE TE2000-U; Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) equip- ped with a 100�, 1.49 numerical aperture (NA) oil-immersion objective lens. The excitation and emission wavelengths were selected with the lter set GFP-BP (suitable for Alexa 488, EX480/ 40, DM505, and BA535/50) produced by Nikon. A uorescence image of the labelled glutaminase was captured on an electron- multiplying charge-coupled device (EM-CCD) camera (ImagEM; C-9100-13, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Shizuoka, Japan) and recorded using an image processor (AQUACOSMOS analysis soware; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). Simultaneously, the corresponding image of mesoporous silica particles, used as capsules for the enzyme, was independently obtained by DIC microscopy.

The enzymatic activities of glutaminase–SBA (SBA5.4 or SBA23.6) composites in the batch experiment were measured for the synthesis reaction forming L-theanine from 2 substrates, 20 mM glutamine and 100 mM ethylamine (pH 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). A 1.1 mL sample of the reaction mixture containing 50 mg glutaminase in the composite form, along with the substrates, was gently shaken using a rotator for 1 h at 20 �C. The reaction was terminated by adding perchloric acid, aer which gluta- minase activity was evaluated by determining the amounts of

L-theanine and L-glutamic acid as a by-product using a high- performance liquid chromatograph (LaChrom Elite; Hitachi High-Technologies Corp.) equipped with an octadecylsilyl- column (LaChrom C18-AQ; particle diameter: 5 mm, Hitachi High-Technologies Corp.). The sample component was sepa- rated with the mobile phase (liquid composition; H2O–meth- anol–triuoroacetic acid ¼ 980 : 20 : 1) at 0.5 mL min�1 for 12 min at 30 �C, and the detection of L-theanine and L-glutamic acid was performed using a UV detector at 210 nm. For comparison purposes, the enzymatic activities of the free enzymes without mesoporous silica were measured. The enzy- matic activity was characterised in terms of conversion ratio (CR) which is calculated using the following equation (eqn (1)):

where c0(glutamine) is the initial glutamine concentration (20 mM), c(theanine) is the theanine concentration aer the g-glutamyl transfer reaction. In order to assess the ow system, the glutamine–ethylamine reaction solution was added to the ow channel containing the immobilised enzyme. The substrate solution (20 mM gluta- mine–100 mM ethylamine) was passed through the reactor at 5 or 10 mL min�1, and the theanine synthesis by the immobilised glutaminase was carried out at various reaction temperatures (4, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 �C) and pH of substrate solutions (pH 4 and 10). Recovery of product solution from the outlet of the ow channel commenced aer an initial 300 mL pre-delivery delay of substrate solution using a syringe pump to reach the steady- state ow in the microreactor. In cases where the entire microreactor system, including substrate supply, the main unit of the reactor, and the product collection area, were heated (total heating), the temperature in the system was controlled using an air heat-type incubator (MIR-154; SANYO Electric Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). In cases where the main unit of the reactor within the microreactor system was locally heated (local heat- ing), the temperature in the main reactor was controlled by temperature control units (Stage top incubator, INU-ONICS; Tokai Hit Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan), while both the substrate supply and the product collection area were kept at 4 �C, using the air incubator mentioned above (Fig. S2, ESI†). Temperatures were made to alternate between 4 �C and 30 �C during the continuous microow reaction by powering the temperature control units equipped with the microreactor oﬀ or on, respectively. The pH values were made to alternate between pH 4 and 10 by changing the pH of the delivery solution. Aer the initial 300 mL pre-delivery, the substrate solutions were passed through the microreactor for 20 straight assays without

Theanine synthesis by glutaminase was used as a model reac- tion in batch and microow reactions. Theanine, which has been utilised as a food additive and dietary supplement, can be synthesized eﬃciently by a g-glutamyl transfer reaction using glutaminase under basic reaction conditions (pH 10–11).25,31

Because a mixture of 2 substrates acting as a g-glutamyl donor– acceptor pair is required, in this work, a combination of gluta- mine (donor) and ethylamine (acceptor) was used. The reaction proceeds via g-glutamyl transfer from glutamine to ethylamine, with a suppression of the hydrolysis of glutamine, i.e., conver- sion of L-glutamine to L-theanine (Scheme 1).32,33

L-theanine solutions were collected from the outlet of the microreactor and the glutaminase activity was evaluated by the measuring method previously described.

Eﬀect of pore size of mesoporous silicas on adsorption of enzyme and the activity in batch reaction

As the mesoporous silica capsules for the enzyme, we prepared two SBA-15-type mesoporous silicas (SBA5.4 and SBA23.6). The ordered mesopores of calcined SBAs were conrmed by measuring nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore-size distribution curves of dried powder samples (Fig. 2). The structural parameters and the SEM images of the SBA series are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3, respectively. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2b, the pore diameters of SBA5.4 and SBA23.6 were 5.4 nm and 23.6 nm, respectively. These data indicated that SBAs with diﬀerent pore sizes were successfully prepared, although the particle morphologies of SBAs were considerably diﬀerent, as is clear from the SEM images of SBA5.4 (Fig. 3a, rod-like) and SBA23.6 (Fig. 3b, sphere with 4 mm particle diameter). Before assessing theanine synthesis in the glutaminase–SBA composite contained in microreactor, batch experiments were

carried out to investigate the enzyme-encapsulation eﬃcacy and catalytic function under high pH conditions (Fig. 4). In this study, the engineered glutaminase was prepared as an enzyme solution of high purity and used for the experiments.

The amounts of glutaminase adsorbed to SBA5.4 (white squares) and SBA23.6 (black squares) in 100 mM ethylamine hydrochloride solution (pH 5.5) were measured spectrophotometrically with respect to the equilib- rium concentrations of glutaminase.

In encapsulation of glutaminase in the mesopores of SBAs, rst, the eﬀect of pore sizes of the 2 SBAs on the amounts of glutaminase adsorbed on the SBA pores in 100 mM ethylamine hydrochloride solution (pH 5.5) was conrmed by a batch experiment (Fig. 4a). As shown in Fig. 4a, the amount of glutaminase adsorbed to SBA23.6 was notably larger than that adsorbed to SBA5.4, indicating that the amount of adsorbed enzyme was greatly dependent on the pore size of the SBAs. The proportion of glutaminase adsorbed onto the pores of the SBA23.6 was found to be up to approximately 10 wt% (by weight of SBA23.6), which was 3 times higher than that of the gluta- minase adsorbed to SBA5.4. From this result, it could be surmised that it is diﬃcult to encapsulate the enzyme easily in the pores of SBA5.4 with a 5.4 nm pore diameter, because glutaminase is approximately 5–6 nm in dimension;34 that is, pores larger than the size of the enzyme is required for eﬃcient encapsulation of enzyme. However, the maximum amount of glutaminase adsorbed on SBA23.6 (10 wt.%) (Fig. 4a) was lower than that adsorbed on TMPS10.6 (Taiyo Kagaku Meso Porous Silica, 10.6 nm pore diameter) (14 wt%), which was used in our previous study.13 However, the TMPS10.6 was modied with a zirconia compound and then treated with 3-glycidoxypropyl- trimethoxysilane to eﬃciently immobilise more enzyme. Although the amount of immobilised enzyme in the unmodi- ed SBA23.6 was approximately 70% of that in modied TMPS10.6, the enzyme did not leach from the enzyme–SBA23.6 composite during the 2 wash steps despite the non-chemical surface modication of the pores. This indicates that the mes- opores of the calcined SBA do not require pre-treatment (such as chemical cross-linking between the enzyme and solid support) to prevent enzyme leaching. Therefore, SBA23.6 is a relatively cost-eﬃcient support material for reagent-free enzyme immobilisation and is superior to modied TMPS10.6. The enzymatic activities of the obtained glutaminase–SBA composites were next measured in batch reactions (Fig. 4b) before attempting an actual microow reaction with a micro- reactor containing the composites. The batch enzymatic reac- tions using the glutaminase–SBA composites had to be carried out at a moderate mixing speed, because the mesoporous framework degrades under vigorous stirring because of its low mechanical strength. In the batch experiments, the enzymes that were adsorbed to mesopores of SBAs demonstrated diﬀerent activities. As shown in Fig. 4b, the glutaminase–SBA5.4 composite had 47.8% of the activity of the native SBA-free glutaminase in theanine production. On the other hand, the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite had activity comparable to that of the free glutaminase (retained activity: 91.3% of that for the free enzyme), even aer the adsorption. These results indicated that the diﬀerence of the pore size between SBA5.4 and SBA23.6 had a considerable eﬀect on the activity of gluta- minase under these reaction conditions. The higher remaining activity for the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite was likely due to the larger pores of SBA23.6 and the structure of the meso- porous channels. In other words, this suggests that the strength of substrate-immobilised enzyme interactions can be enhanced by the eﬃcient introduction of the substrate into the SBAs with larger pores. Similar results have been reported for lipase

The eﬃciency of the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite in synthesis of L-theanine at various reaction temperatures (a temperature range of 4–50 �C) was also of a comparable level to that of the free enzyme (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating that the mesoporous framework of SBA23.6 did not inhibit the theanine synthesis by glutaminase regardless of the reaction temperature. From these results, we considered that the pore size of SBA23.6 was more eﬃcient for encapsulating glutaminase and conducting theanine synthesis. Thus, the SBA-15 microsphere (i.e., SBA23.6) was used for the subsequent enzyme encapsula- tion and the microow reaction using the enzyme microreactor.

Evaluation of conversion and selectivity in theanine synthesis by glutaminase–SBA composites

To examine the optimal substrate solution for synthesis of L-the- anine by the encapsulated enzyme, the eﬀect of pH value of the substrate solution containing 20 mM glutamine and 100 mM ethylamineontheconversionsof L-glutaminetoL-theaninebyfree glutaminase and glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite was conrmed in batch experiments (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, theanine production was predominant at pH 10 in the cases of both free glutaminase and glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite. The optimal pH value for simultaneous hydrolysis of glutamine, i.e., conversion of L-glutamine to L-glutamic acid, was pH 8. Interest- ingly, conversions to L-glutamic acid as a by-product by the free glutaminase and the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite at pH 10 were 37.7 and 2.5%, respectively. Therefore, it was found that the selectivity of L-theanine in the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite (94.4%) was markedly higher than that of free glutaminase without SBA (54.9%) under these reaction conditions. This diﬀerence in enzymatic selectivity behaviour with and without mesoporous silica may be attributed to the diﬀerence in accessi- bility of water molecules to the active centre of the enzymes encapsulated in the mesopores; that is, it can be presumed that water molecules, which are required for glutamine hydrolysis, could not diﬀuse extensively into the pores of SBA, because of the high hydrophobicity of SBA-15-type mesoporous silica (hydro- phobicity for pore surface of SBA > that of FSM).35 Thus, we demonstrated the selective conversion to L-theanine by gluta- minase–SBA23.6 composite as far as the theanine synthesis reaction between the glutamine, the ethylamine and the gluta- minase derived from Pseudomonas nitroreducens is concerned.

Direct observation of glutaminase immobilised in microreactor

In order to directly conrm the specic and stable encapsula- tion of glutaminase by the SBA23.6 in the ow-type micro- reactor, uorescently labelled enzyme adsorbed to SBA microspheres in the reactor was observed by uorescence microscopy containing DIC with a high-sensitivity EM-CCD camera. Fig. 5 shows a picture of the enzyme microreactor fabricated in this study (Fig. 5a) and the corresponding uo- rescence images of glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite particles immobilised in the microreactor (Fig. 5b and c). First, the

a Reaction conditions: enzyme content, 50 mg; composition of substrate, 20 mM glutamine–100 mM ethylamine (pH 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12); total volume of reaction mixture, 1.1 mL; reaction time, 1 h; reaction temperature, 20 �C. The conversions to L-theanine by free glutaminase and glutaminase– SBA23.6 composite at pH 10 correspond to those shown in Fig. 4b.

immobilised in the ow channel by direct visualization using optical microscopy. The xed SBA23.6 particles with a 4 mm particle diameter in 100 mM ethylamine hydrochloride solution (pH 5.5) were successfully observed individually by DIC microscopy (Fig. 5c, upper). Next, green emission due to the Alexa 488 dye was conrmed in a same microscope eld of the SBA particles when they were irradiated with an excitation light (480/40 nm; Fig. 5c, lower panel), indicating that glutaminase molecules were present in the particles. As observed from the microscopic image of the Alexa 488 dye-labelled glutaminase, the area of uorescence emission from the enzyme was distributed evenly across the microspheres, suggesting that the distribution of glutaminase in the silica particle was uniform. This uniform distribution was attributed to the successful encapsulation of the enzyme in the SBA23.6 mesopores. As reported previously, if the labelled enzymes were adsorbed mainly on the surfaces of the mesoporous silica particles with small pore sizes, uorescent enhancement would be obtained from the edges of the particles, because enzymes with sizes larger than the pores of the silica particles cannot penetrate beyond the entrance of the pores.36 In Fig. 5c (lower panel), a high signal-to-noise ratio for the image of the labelled enzymes was obtained and maintained during real-time observation, resulting from both the specic adsorption of the labelled enzyme to the silica particle rather than to the PDMS membrane in the ow channel and suppression of the leaching of the enzyme from the immobilised composite into the solution. From the abovementioned experiments, based on the direct visualization of glutaminase–SBA23.6 composites, we presumed that the pore size of the SBA23.6 is suitable for encapsulating the enzyme and that the enzymes are indeed encapsulated in the SBA microsphere, as shown in Fig. 5d.

pattern of immobilisation area for the Alexa Fluor 488 dye- labelled glutaminase in the microreactor was conrmed by scanning the entire microreactor with a uorescence-image analyser (Fig. 5b). The area of uorescence emission from the enzyme was distributed evenly from inlet to outlet in the microow channel, suggesting that the distribution of the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composites in the channel was uniform. The amount of the immobilised glutaminase per unit area was estimated to be approximately 20 ng mm�2 from the standard curve of uorescence intensities of Alexa 488 dye-labelled glutaminase–SBA23.6 composites determined by the above image analyser. We further evaluated the encapsulation and the relative localization of the glutaminase in SBA23.6 particles

We next attempted to use a ow-type microreactor containing the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composites for continuous synthesis of L-theanine. In the industrial process of L-theanine production with ethylamine as a g-glutamyl acceptor, it is necessary to carry out the synthesis reaction at a low temperature owing to the low

theanine (Fig. 6a). As is clear from the gure, interestingly, higher conversion ratios were obtained at each temperature, except for 4 �C, when the main unit of the reactor was heated with local temperature control units, compared to use of total heating. At the optimal reaction temperature (30 �C) for the- anine synthesis, the conversion ratio in the case of local heating was approximately 2 times higher than that in the case of total heating. From these results, it can be speculated that the higher activity shown in local heating of the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composites in the microreactor is associated with suppression of the production of gas-phase ethylamine in the substrate supply unit, given the low boiling point of ethylamine (16.6 �C), during the theanine synthesis reaction. From Fig. 6a, it was found that the activities of the immobilised enzymes increased by local heating in the following order: 30 �C > 20 �C > 10 �C > 40 �C > 4 �C > 50 �C. On the other hand, the activity measured when the entire microreactor system, including the substrate supply, main unit of reactor, and product collection area, was heated to 40 �C, was lower than that at 4 �C, and no production of the- anine was obtained at 50 �C. Furthermore, the conversion ratio at 40 �C in the case of local heating was approximately 4 times higher than that in the case of total heating, supporting the above hypothesis that the ethylamine is vaporised at a temperature range of 10–50 �C. To investigate precise regulation of L-theanine synthesis in the continuous microow reaction, in addition to the above advantage of local temperature control in the reaction system, we also examined the inuence of changes of both reaction temperature and pH value of the substrate solution, containing 20 mM glutamine and 100 mM ethylamine, on the conversions of L-glutamine to L-theanine in a glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite-xed microreactor (Fig. 6b). When the enzymatic activity of the immobilised glutaminase at staggered tempera- tures (i.e., 4 and 30 �C) during the continuous theanine synthesis at pH 10 was evaluated with local heating (ow rate of substrate: 5 mL min�1), the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composites contained in the microreactor indicated alternately the gradual increase and decrease of the conversion to L-theanine at 30 and �C, respectively. The maximum conversion ratio in this microreactor (at 30 �C and a ow rate of 5 mL min�1) was approximately 50%, which was higher than that of the prototype enzymatic microreactor with surface-modied TMPS10.6 used in our previous study (maximum conversion ratio: ca. 10%).13

boiling point of ethylamine (16.6 �C). Therefore, the entire microreactor system, including the substrate supply (inlet), main unit of reactor, and product collection area (outlet), were chilled to 4 �C during the theanine synthesis. Further, in order to enhance the enzymatic activity, local control of the reaction temperature (4–50 �C) in the enzyme-encapsulated microow channel was attempted (Fig. 1b). In the ow system in this study, rst, a reaction solution containing the 2 substrates (20 mM glutamine–100 mM ethyl- amine, pH 10) was added into the ow channel containing the immobilised enzyme (ow rate of substrate: 10 mL min�1). We examined whether various reaction temperatures (4, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 �C) with total or local heating of the enzymatic reaction eld in the microreactor aﬀected the conversion to L-

Reaction conditions: enzyme content, ca. 50 mg; composition of substrate, 20 mM glutamine–100 mM ethylamine (pH 10); flow rate of substrate solution: 10 mL min�1; reaction time, 30 min. The conversions to L-theanine were measured thrice per exper- imental point (N ¼ 3). (b) Eﬀect of reaction temperature and pH of substrate solution on the theanine production during the continuous reaction by local heating of enzymatic reaction field in the micro- reactor. Reaction conditions: composition of substrate, 20 mM glutamine–100 mM ethylamine (pH 10 constant in the case of temperature control, pH 4 or 10 in the case of pH control); reaction temperature, 4 or 30 �C in the case of temperature control, 30 �C constant in the case of pH control; flow rate of substrate solution: 5 mL min�1; reaction time, 15 min.

When the eﬀect of conversion to L-theanine on residence time was examined, an increase in conversion in proportion to the residence times was conrmed. A similar tendency was observed with both the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite-xed microreactor and the glutaminase–TMPS10.6 composite-xed microreactor, indicating that the performance of the current enzymatic microreactor was equivalent to that of the prototype microreactor despite the non-chemical surface modication of the pores (Fig. S4, ESI†). This increased conversion in the new enzyme microreactor was due to both the improved micro- channel length and the optimised pore size of the silica support for reagent-free, stable enzyme immobilisation. Moreover, we could terminate the theanine production completely by rapid cooling to the vicinity of 0 �C, resulting in temporary oﬀ-

glutaminase–SBA23.6 microreactor allowed a marked increase in conversion ratio and precise regulation of L-theanine synthesis during continuous theanine production. Control of enzyme activity was achieved by means of local heating of the reaction eld in the ow channel, so avoiding eﬀects on temperature-sensitive reactants, and by controlling the pH value of the substrate solution during solution supply. Hence, this novel microuidic reactor system using mesoporous silica as a scaﬀold for enzyme-immobilisation enables eﬃcient continuous synthesis of functional compounds, even from reactive substrates with low boiling points and low thermal stability, and eﬀective on-oﬀ regulation of enzymatic activity by means of accurate control of the reaction temperature and the pH in the micro-reaction eld.

regulation of the enzymatic activity. In addition, as was the case with temperature control, alternately supplied substrate solu- tion with a diﬀerent value of pH (i.e., pH 4 and 10) led to uc- tuation of the conversion. The behaviour indicated in the above results suggested that the eﬃciency of the enzymatic reaction could be controlled accurately by adjusting both the reaction temperature and the pH value of the substrate solution during the microow reactions. However, the conversion ratios at the same temperature and pH range were not equivalent. This suggests that, under these experimental conditions, it was diﬃcult to instantaneously maximize enzymatic activity by controlling the temperature and pH in the continuous micro- ow reaction because a specic incubation time or substrate solution was required to reach the desired temperature and pH in areas surrounding the encapsulated enzyme. When comparing between the 2 cases, a maximum conversion ratio in the case of temperature control was clearly higher than that in the case of pH control, even when maintaining the same reac- tion conditions (in pH 10 at 30 �C). We considered that the lower enzymatic activity shown with the pH change is because the pH environment surrounding the active centre of the enzyme in the pores of mesoporous silica does not reach the optimal pH for theanine synthesis, owing to the particular space within the mesopores. Therefore, it can be said that the regu- lation of reaction temperature in the microow reaction could aﬀect and control enzyme activity more quickly and easily than regulation via reaction pH. The alternate on-oﬀ regulation of enzymatic activity during prolonged addition of the substrate solution in 20 assays observed in Fig. 6b may be due to retention of a stable immobilised state of glutaminase; that is, it can be suggested that enzyme molecules encapsulated in the pores do not experience the reduced activity associated with the leaching of the enzyme from the ow channel during continuous reactions. Thus, these results suggested that signicant enhance- ment of the enzymatic activity in the enzyme–mesoporous silica composite provides the possibility of high productivity of L-theanine, by using this novel enzyme microreactor, and due to the sustained operational stability of the composites immobilised in the ow channel, which also facilitated retention of the activity of the encapsulated enzyme.

In this study, recombinant glutaminase, derived from Pseudo- monas nitroreducens IFO12694, was encapsulated in 2 types of mesoporous silicas (SBA5.4 and SBA23.6), and the eﬃcient, stable immobilisation of the enzyme and its selectivity for production of L-theanine without production of L-glutamic acid as a by-product was conrmed for the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite in batch experiments.
