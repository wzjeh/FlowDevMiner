less steel, and the inner diameter, outer diameter, and length were 3.8, 6.4, and 80.0 mm, respectively. Four pieces of monolithic cat- alysts were packed in the middle of the MPB, and other parts of the MPB were packed with untreated nickel foams. AMS dissolved in methanol (Shanghai Titan Technology Co., Ltd., China) was pumped and mixed with pure hydrogen from reg- ulated cylinder, and then flowed into the MPB. The MPB was installed in a water bath to control the reaction temperature (T) at 70 �C, and a back pressure regulator was employed to control the system pressure (P) at 1.0 MPa. AMS initial concentration (CAMS) and the gas flow rate (G) were set as 10 wt% and 20 mL�min�1, respectively. The liquid flow rate (Q) of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mL�min�1 was chosen in the experiments. When the reaction was stable, the liquid samples from the outlet of MPB were collected, diluted, and then analyzed by a gas chro- matography (GC, 8860, Agilent Technologies Co., Ltd., U.S.) with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary column (HP-5, 30 m � 0.32 mm � 0.25 lm). The same MPB packed with Pd/Al2O3 particle catalysts was employed in this work for the comparison of hydrogenation perfor- mance. The catalysts were prepared by loading active component Pd on Al2O3 particles with the same method in Section 2.1. The Pd concentration of catalysts was controlled as 0.3 wt%, and the catalysts with 0.04 g were used for the similar content of Pd as the monolithic catalysts. The diameter of Al2O3 particles was about 460 lm, by which the similar channels as the nickel foam can be created. The particle catalysts were also packed in the middle of MPB, and other parts of the MPB were packed with blank Al2O3 particles.

3.2.1. Catalyst activity The hydrogenation reaction was performed in the MPB with the similar Pd content of about 0.00012 g for both particle catalysts and monolithic catalysts. The effect of liquid flow rate on the activ- ity of particle catalysts and monolithic catalysts is shown in Fig. 7. The AMS conversion decreased with the increase of liquid flow rate. Although the increase of liquid flow rate may improve the mass transfer efficiency, AMS cannot contact adequately with Pd sites and flows directly through the reactor at high liquid flow rate. With increasing the liquid flow rate, the residence time of liquid reactant decreased. The decreasing tendency of conversion at high liquid flow rate was not significant than that at low liquid flow rate. Comparing the activity of the monolithic catalysts with the same content of Pd, the catalysts with Pd/CeO2 and Pd/CaCO3 coat- ings had the highest and lowest AMS conversion, respectively. The catalysts with Pd/Al2O3, Pd/SiO2, and Pd/TiO2 coatings had little difference in AMS conversion. The possible reason is that there was difference in the textural properties between the coatings, and the capabilities of the coatings for the combination and storage of gas and liquid reactants were also different. Besides, the unifor-

The overall external mass transfer performance was measured by the hydrogenation of AMS in methylcyclohexane (Shanghai Meryer Chemical Technology Co., Ltd., China) with the same exper- imental setup as the catalyst performance test in Section 2.2. The mass transfer performance of MPB both packed with monolithic catalysts and particle catalysts was investigated. The reaction tem- perature, pressure, AMS initial concentration, and gas flow rate were set as 30 �C, 0.6 MPa, 10 wt%, and 20 mL�min�1, respectively. The AMS hydrogenation is an extremely fast reaction and enables to reach a fully mass transfer limited regime even at moderate temperature and pressure (Meille et al., 2004; Lévêque et al., 2016). Assuming a plug flow model, the apparent rate of reaction (ra) can be determined by an integration of a steady state mass bal- ance over the whole catalysts (Tourvieille et al., 2013; Tourvieille et al., 2015). The apparent rate can be expressed in terms of the AMS conversion and the liquid flow rate, as shown in equation (1) (Haase et al., 2013; Sang et al., 2020).

have attracted substantial attentions (Nuzhdin et al., 2015; Vilé et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017). Compared with conventional trickle bed reactors, MPBs have the small dimensional scale and are packed with small particles (diameters < 500 lm) (Ranade et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2018), which exhibit the advantages of high surface-to-volume ratio, enhanced mass transfer, fast multi- phase mixing, and excellent operating safety (Liu et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2019). At present, MPBs have been widely applied in

mity of active component Pd dispersed on the coatings can also affect the catalyst activity. For the investigation of the uniformity, the Pd distribution on the coatings was analyzed through the EDS mapping images, as shown in Fig. 8, which are corresponding to the SEM micrographs in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the Pd dispersed on Al2O3, SiO2, CeO2, TiO2, and CaCO3 coatings was uniform. This indicated that the coat- ings prepared by slurry circulation can promote the uniformity of Pd distribution because of the uniform distribution of the coatings. Therefore, Pd distribution may have little effect on the catalyst activity, and the difference in catalyst activity mainly depend on the properties of coatings. The monolithic catalysts had the higher AMS conversion com- pared with the particle catalysts, as shown in Fig. 7. At the liquid flow rate of 0.05 mL�min�1, the AMS conversion of Pd/Al2O3/nickel foam and Pd/Al2O3 particle catalysts had the maximum difference as 60.5%. The Pd distribution on the particle catalysts was also uni- form, as shown in Fig. 8(a). Although the particles had the higher Al2O3 content and the larger specific surface area, there was higher internal mass transfer resistance inside the catalysts, and it is more difficult for the reactants to reach the Pd sites in the particles. This suggested that the thin layer of Al2O3 coatings on nickel foams had significant advantages for the improvement of active component utilization and internal mass transfer.

liquid, respectively. The equation (6) was chosen because the hydrogenation conditions (30 �C and 0.6 MPa) were similar as those in the literature (Meille et al., 2002), and referring to the estimated kinetic parameters by Meille et al., k0 = 8.5 � 106 mol�s�1�g�1 Pd , Ea = 38.7 � 103 J�mol�1, and kH2 = 1.4 � 10�2 m3�mol�1. The unknown parameters in equations (1)–(6) were Cs H2, g, and U, which can be easily calculated to obtain kOV.

3.2.2. Catalyst stability The catalyst stability is one of the important parameters for cat- alytic reactions, so the long-term stability and the mechanical sta- bility were investigated in this work. Fig. 9 displays the activity of particle catalysts and monolithic catalysts in the MPB for 72 h. Obviously, the stabilities of all catalysts were fairly high. The activ- ity of the monolithic catalysts with Al2O3 and SiO2 coatings slightly decreased in the first 16 h because of a small loss of catalyst coat- ings. Subsequently, the activity remained stable for a period of 56 h. In contrast, the activity of the particle catalysts and the monolithic catalysts with CeO2, TiO2, and CaCO3 coatings slowly decreased in 72 h. The possible reason is that the mass loss of par- ticles and coatings occurred during the gas and liquid scouring. The decrease of AMS conversion for the particle catalysts and the monolithic catalysts with Al2O3, SiO2, CeO2, TiO2, and CaCO3 coat- ings was 1.5%, 4.8%, 3.0%, 6.0%, 7.0%, and 6.2%, respectively. Com- pared with the monolithic catalysts, the particle catalysts had relatively higher stability because the adhesion between Al2O3 was stronger than that between Al2O3 and nickel foam. Compared with nickel foam, Al2O3 particles have more rough structures on the surface and between the particles. Other Al2O3 particles dif- fused into these structures, which can provide mechanical adhe- sion. In addition, the surface of Al2O3 particles adsorbed more polar groups than that of nickel foam, promoting the formation of more chemical bonds between Al2O3 particles to improve adhe- sion. These are beneficial to the improvement of stability. Among the monolithic catalysts, Pd/SiO2/nickel foam catalysts demon- strated the highest stability by reason of the strongest adhesion. After the long-term experiments, the catalysts were washed and dried, and the mass loss before and after the experiments was measured to evaluate the mechanical stability. The mass losses of the particle catalysts and the monolithic catalysts with Al2O3, SiO2, CeO2, TiO2, and CaCO3 coatings were 1.6%, 3.2%, 2.4%, 5.6%, 8.1%, and 6.3%, respectively. The order of mechanical stability was quite consistent with that of long-term stability. This verified that the decrease in activity mainly resulted from the loss of parti- cles and coatings. The method of slurry circulation for preparing monolithic catalysts can provide high activity and stability during the hydrogenation reaction.
