during UV/H2O2 treatment of industrial wastewater with high nitrogen content [41]. Such conversion pathways could also take place in other samples in this study. Anyway, to test this hypothesis, additional nitrate and nitrite measurements were carried out, which yielded quite interesting results (Figure 3c). The NO2 content was much lower than the NO3 content; the former varied in the range of 24–84 mg/L and the latter in the range of 2829–10,479 mg/L. This means that NH4 was oxidized to nitrite to a small extent, as its content was still quite high. On the other hand, samples P365-1%H2O2 and C(2 g/L FeSO4)-P365-1%H2O2 showed an exceptionally high NO3 content, but lower than the untreated initial sample, reflecting the conversion of N compounds to NO3. Otherwise, the removal efficiency for NO3 ranged from 22.89% (sample C(2 g/L FeSO4)-P365-1%H2O2) to 71.82% (P365-0.2%H2O2). The lowest NH4-N and TN contents were measured in the sample with the longest photo-treatment (sample P365-1%H2O2-20min), with removal efficiencies of 30.7% and 18.6%, respectively. In comparison, UV/H2O2 treatment of industrial wastewater with much lower COD (13,261 mg/L) and TN (569 mg/L) resulted in COD removal efficiencies of 37–65%, and 50% conversion of TN to nitrate and nitrite [41]. The above-mentioned sample also had one of the lowest COD contents and one of the lowest conductivities. The TP and PO4-P contents were significantly lower than those of the sample treated with a shorter retention time (sample P365-1%H2O2). This indicates that increasing the residence time can significantly improve removal efficiency. Phosphorus degradation pathways that can occur simultaneously during UV/H2O2 treatment include oxidative degradation by hydroxyl radicals that break the P–O bond, the P=S bond and other P bonds such as the nitrophenyl bond [36]. An increase in H2O2 concentration and UV irradiation can enhance the conversion of soluble, non-reactive P, such as organic P, into easily degradable and soluble reactive P or orthophosphate, as a higher H2O2 concentration increases the rate of radical formation and thus enhances the oxidation of organophosphorus compounds [42].

constant via the photochemistry module's control system. This ensured that the samples were taken under the specified continuous flow conditions in steady-state operation.

The photochemical treatment was carried out using the Asia Flow Chemistry System (Syrris, Royston, UK), an advanced micro-flow system with different reactor types for solution and solid phase chemistry. The system allows many experiments to be carried out in a short time by using monochromatic light sources of different wavelengths, reducing the treatment time and cost of the process compared to batch systems. The experimental setup (Figure 1) for the HTC process liquid treatment consisted of a syringe pump with two channels (one for pumping the HTC liquid and one for pumping air) connected to a photochemistry module with cryo-controller for temperature control, and equipped with a 4 mL tubular reactor made of fluoropolymer material. The process liquids were treated with a photochemistry module with 4 high-power LED UV modules, allowing rapid photocatalytical reactions and easy scale-up of continuous reactions. A monochromatic light source of wavelength (λ) 365 nm and 420 nm was used separately as a UV light source with 100% power intensity. The operation of the photochemistry module was controlled by a photochemistry controller. The operation of the system and the control of the operating conditions (temperature, pressure, liquid flow, radiation flux, etc.) were monitored via the computer using Asia Manager 1.5 software, while samples of the process liquid were collected manually. As the photo treatment process generates considerable heat in the reaction medium due to light absorption and subsequent photothermal effects, the cryo-controller was used to maintain the solution at exactly 20 ± 0.1 ◦C throughout the experiment and to remove excess heat to ensure that temperature-dependent effects were excluded as a source of variability between experiments. At the beginning of each experiment, the steady-state conditions were first established, i.e., the photochemistry controller was switched on, the number of modules and the light intensity were set, then the desired temperature was set and maintained by the cryo- controller without introducing the feedstock (Figure 1). Once the operating parameters were stable, the solution was pumped into the tubular reactor using a syringe pump. The system was allowed to run for a predetermined residence time, so that a triple amount of liquid flowed through the reactor before sampling. This ensured that the entire reactor volume was completely occupied by the sample and that steady-state conditions were maintained in terms of flow rate and photochemical exposure. The flow rate was maintained by a high- precision syringe with a volume of 2.5 mL, while the light intensity was monitored and kept

of the conversion methods that require the development of innovative approaches and process integration. Advanced conversion and processing methods, such as catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis, torrefaction [2], anaerobic digestion [3], gasification, hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrothermal carbonization [4], have been explored to improve efficiency, reduce costs and enhance the overall sustainability of biofuel production [5]. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has attracted considerable attention in the last decade as it is known as an effective approach for the conversion of particularly wet biomass into solid biofuel at relatively mild temperature conditions (180–350 ◦C) and pressures [6]. In addition to the solid product (hydrochar), this process also produces a liquid byproduct, the so-called process liquid or process water [7]. Due to its complex composition, the process liquid poses numerous challenges that must be solved before it can be disposed of in the environment or further managed [8]. In order to implement HTC as a large-scale treatment alternative for biomass valorization, effective concepts for the treatment of HTC process water are crucial [9]. One of the main problems is the high organic content of the process liquid, as it contains various organic compounds, including volatile fatty acids, phenolic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which result in a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) [10]. These organic compounds can cause environmental pollution and damage aquatic ecosystems if released into the environment. In addition, nitrogen compounds in the process liquid can contribute to the eutrophication of water bodies, promote excessive algae growth and disturb the ecological balance [11]. As the composition of the process liquid is highly dependent on the type of feedstock used in the HTC process, its treatment is complex and requires integrated approaches that prioritize environmental protection, resource recovery, sustainability and circular economy principles [12]. According to the literature, the intelligent utilization or treatment of the HTC process fluid has been little researched to date. The most common treatment strategies, i.e., treatment methods, proposed by previous researchers for the treatment of HTC process liquids include biological treatment with microorganisms such as bacteria or fungi [13], ultrafiltration and other membrane treatment processes [12], advanced oxidation processes [14] and some other methods. In particular, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as photochemical [15] and photocatalytic UV irradiation [16] and electrochemical oxidation [9] have proven to be very effective for these purposes, as they degrade organic pollutants very effectively. There are still many unresolved issues related to their application that need to be addressed, including the high operating costs and energy demand, the need for chemical reagents (e.g., H2O2, catalysts), the formation of refractory or toxic byproducts, limited mineralization efficiency (partial oxidation to small organic acids), challenges in transferring laboratory systems to industrial systems, and uncertainties regarding the environmental impact and management of residual sludge and secondary waste [17]. Furthermore, relatively few scientific papers have investigated these techniques for the treatment of HTC process liquids, although recent reports have provided encouraging results. For example, electrochemical oxidation using Na2SO4 and NaCl as supporting electrolytes was successful in treating HTC process liquid from olive tree pruning [18]. The HTC process liquid from banana peels was used as feedstock in microbial fuel cells, achieving COD reduction of up to 85% in combination with the generation of electrical power [19]. In another study, the electrochemical oxidation of process water from HTC-treated sewage sludge was investigated [9]. Studies dealing with the photochemical treatment of hydrothermal process liquid are even rarer, which emphasizes the novelty and importance of the present study. To the authors' knowledge, only three studies are available in the literature. In one of them, pho- tocatalytic treatment of wastewater from the hydrothermal liquefaction of algae was used for efficient COD removal and colour reduction in the presence of H2O2 as an oxidant [16].

Article Investigation of the Influencing Parameters of the H2O2-Assisted Photochemical Treatment of Waste Liquid from the Hydrothermal Carbonization Process in a Microreactor Flow System

The use of fossil fuels has led to environmental problems and prompted the develop- ment of alternative energy sources such as biofuels. Among the various types of biofuels, those derived from waste biomass, energy crops and microalgae hold particular promise for reducing dependence on fossil fuels [1]. However, there are still many challenges in large-scale production of biofuels, including high costs associated with feedstock col- lection and preprocessing, low conversion efficiencies, and the energy-intensive nature

(COD and TOC), as well as phosphorus and nitrogen content. In general, singlet oxygen plays an important role in the degradation of organic contaminants and can also be pro- duced as a naturally occurring photosensitizer when organic matter in water media is irradiated [28], but in the present study, air-derived singlet oxygen played only a minor role, suggesting that it does not contribute significantly to singlet oxygen production. Since the untreated process liquid contains naturally dissolved oxygen (5.39 ± 0.03 mg/L), and was not degassed, this would probably explain the insignificant differences in removal efficiency between samples P420 and P420 (no air). If pure O2 was introduced, the differ- ences would most likely be larger, due to improved singlet oxygen formation. However, since the formation of singlet oxygen was not monitored experimentally, this is only a prediction. Otherwise, the dissolved oxygen content was higher in photo-treated samples than in untreated samples, especially in samples with higher H2O2 dosage, with the highest value measured in the sample containing DES (Figure 3f). H2O2 proved to be an effective oxidizing agent in both dosages tested, which is to be expected as it is considered one of the strongest oxidizing agents. The increase in dosage from 0.2 to 1 vol% was reflected in a significant decrease in COD and phosphorus content, while the decrease in TOC content was lower. The improvement in COD removal efficiency (from 20.9% at 0.2 vol.% dosage of H2O2 to 31.6 at 1 vol% of H2O2) is due to an increased and faster generation of OH radicals, and H2O2 reacts more intensively with UV light at lower wavelengths, especially below 300 nm [29]. These values are comparable to the efficiency of COD reduction achieved in the photocatalytic treatment of liquids from the hydrothermal liquefaction process, where 23% of the COD was removed [16]. Another researcher reported much higher efficiencies for the H2O2/UV and photo-Fenton processes in the treatment of real high-concentration aqueous waste, with COD removal efficiencies of over 70% [30]. The additional test in the absence of light under the same operating conditions (see Table S1, Supplementary Materials), confirmed the importance of the light source in the UV treatment and that the addition of H2O2 has only a minor effect on the removal efficiency in the absence of light. However, the literature shows that the H2O2 dosage varies greatly depending on the type and composition of the treated solution. For example, for photocatalytic UV treatment of wastewater from hydrothermal liquefaction at 254 nm wavelength in the presence of TiO2 as a catalyst [16], a dosage between 0.25 and 0.5 g H2O2 in relation to gCOD was used, and the higher the H2O2 concentration was, the higher the reduction efficiency as the production of radicals was enhanced. In another study, dosages between 0.1 and 1.2 g/L H2O2 were reported to be efficient for the treatment of dye wastewater [27]. The improvement in removal efficiency and the differences between samples P365- 0.2%H2O2 and P420-0.2%H2O2 could also be partly explained by the higher energy of the light reaching the sample, as the radiant flux in experiment E4 (sample P365-0.2%H2O2) was higher (48.5 W) than in experiment E3, which was performed at 420 nm (35.7 W). The reac- tion of H2O2 with UV light, which catalyzes the degradation of H2O2 and leads to the forma- tion of hydroxyl radicals, can be represented by the following reaction (Equation (1)) [31]:

Due to its complex composition and toxicity, the waste liquid from hydrothermal carboniza- tion (HTC) poses a serious environmental challenge that must be addressed before disposal. In this study, the photochemical treatment of HTC liquid in a microreactor flow system was investigated. The effects of wavelength, the presence of atmospheric oxygen, oxidizing agent (H2O2) and catalyst (FeSO4), residence time and pH on the efficiency of the photo- treatment were investigated. In addition, the influence of the addition of deep eutectic solvent (DES) on photo-treatment was studied. The results showed that the photochemical treatment was more efficient at 365 nm than at 420 nm, and that the acidic conditions gave better results than the basic ones. UV365 treatment in the presence of H2O2 (at a dosage of 1 vol%) resulted in removal efficiencies of 31.6% for COD, 17.6% for TOC, 16.9% for NH4-N and 17.2% for PO4-P. The addition of FeSO4 caused coagulation/flocculation effects, but improved phosphorus removal. The addition of DES resulted in slight discolouration of the liquid and proved unsuccessful in COD removal. The GC-MS analysis and 3D-EEM spectra showed significant changes in the fate of organics and in the fluorescence intensity of aromatic proteins and humic acid-like substances. Photochemical treatment in a microre- actor flow system in the presence of H2O2 under the selected operating conditions reduced the content of organics and nutrients in the HTC liquid, but the process liquids still showed toxic effects on the organisms V. fischeri and Daphnia magna.

The total phenolic content (Figure 2b) of the samples treated at 420 nm was more or less the same as that of the untreated sample, while the samples treated at 365 nm with a higher amount of H2O2 or with FeSO4 showed a lower content of phenols. Phenolic compounds (phenols, cresols, hydroxybenzoic acids, etc.) are one of the main components of HTC process liquids as they are formed during the thermal degradation of lignin and hemicellulose [37]. During light irradiation, they are first degraded to intermediates such as short-chain and hydroxylated compounds, and then mineralized to CO2 and H2O [38]. In the presence of Fe, which may still be present in the solution after partial coagulation/flocculation, the so-called photo-Fenton process could also take place, in which Fe2+ acts as a catalyst in the Fenton reaction and the generated hydroxyl radicals attack and open the aromatic rings and convert them into short-chain aldehydes, carboxylic acids or CO2. Chemical analysis of the HTC liquids after their flocculation confirmed that Fe is still present in the solution (171 mg/L was detected in the sample exposed to FeSO4 dosage of 1 g/L and 296 mg/L in the sample exposed to 2 g/L of FeSO4, while the untreated sample contained only 6 mg/L Fe), which means that the Fenton process could take place. However, Maillard products and cyclization products, which are usually present in the HTC liquids, are hardly oxidized to CO2 and H2O according to Liu et al. [32]. On the other hand, the aromatic methoxy groups present in the aromatic compounds of HTC liquids can participate in the formation of CO, which is another possible product of the photodegradation of dissolved organic matter [39]. At the same time, the TOC in the process liquids remains high, as the carbon remains in solution in the form of organic acids, aldehydes, etc. The content of organic acids (Figure 2b) in most of the treated samples, with the excep- tion of sample P365-1%H2O2-20min, increases as large, complex molecules are broken down into smaller, more oxidized fragments, such as aldehydes, ketones and short-chain car- boxylic acids (acetic, propionic and other acids). Samples P365-1%H2O2 and P365-1%H2O2- pH7.5 had the highest content of organic acids alongside sample P365-2%H2O2-5%DES (the reason for the latter is the addition of DES). Sample P365-1%H2O2-20min was exposed to photo-treatment for longer than the other samples, allowing further transformation of these fragments, which is reflected in a lower content of organic acids.

In addition to the light source wavelength and the light intensity, the photo-treatment is highly influenced by the retention time, the addition of oxidizing agents and catalysts and their concentration, the temperature of the solution and the presence of inorganic ions in the solution [17]. The photo-oxidation is therefore often enhanced by the addition of catalysts such as TiO2, ZnO, persulphate and Fe2+ salts and other chemical reagents [27]. The photo-treatment of HTC liquid in the presence of 2 vol% H2O2 and 5 vol% DES (experiment E8) resulted in an increase in COD and conductivity, and a slight decrease in TOC compared to untreated HTC liquid. The addition of DES caused a sharp decrease in pH, but contributed to a reduction in colour of the liquid. A very acidic pH leads to low degradation due to the loss of OH ions, as protons prevent the formation of OH radicals [29]. The significant increase in N content is due to the one of the DES components, namely choline chloride, a quaternary ammonium salt. On the other hand, a small decrease in P content was observed compared to untreated HTC liquid. It was expected that DES would make a greater contribution to TOC and COD removal, as it is reported to be able to dissolve organic lipophilic and hydrophilic species, making the oxidation of organic compounds by H2O2 more efficient [33], but according to the results, this is apparently not the case. On the other hand, pre-treatment with FeSO4 (E9 and E10) led to a decrease in COD content, as one of the lowest COD values was measured for the samples C(2 g/L FeSO4)- P365-1%H2O2 and C(1 g/L FeSO4)-P365-1%H2O2, namely 35.2 and 33.7%. Interestingly, the addition of FeSO4 to the HTC liquid causes flocculation/coagulation despite the acidic pH (~5.2). This phenomenon was explained by Kim et al. [34]; at moderate or near-neutral pH, Fe2+ can oxidize to Fe3+, which hydrolyzes at moderate pH, and forms Fe(OH)3 precipitates that act as coagulants and cause flocculation/coagulation via π-interactions and Fe–O bonding. Carboxylic acids, phenols, and humic-like polymers in the HTC liquor complex Fe3+ and adsorb on precipitated Fe(III) hydroxide/phosphate surfaces. This leads to neutralization of colloids and their incorporation into Fe-aggregates. XRD analysis of the precipitated/coagulated solids (Figure S1a, see Supplementary Materials) revealed that both samples treated with FeSO4 produced poorly crystalline solids, most likely Fe-oxides and Fe-hydroxides, consistent with the diffraction peaks observed between 15 and 35◦ 2θ. In the sample treated with 1 g/L FeSO4, the material remained largely amorphous, reflecting a strong incorporation of organic matter from the HTC liquid. At the higher Fe-dosage (2 g/L), the sharp low-angle peaks suggest a more ordered Fe(III) oxyhydroxide crystallization. A similar composition of precipitates was observed when the aqueous phase of hy- drothermal carbonization of sewage sludge was subjected to an iron/persulfate process [35], in which coagulation and precipitation were also caused by the presence of Fe. Since the HTC liquor contains abundant phosphate, a significant amount of iron can precipitate as iron phosphate solids, amorphous/weakly crystalline Fe phosphate in addition to Fe(III) oxyhydroxides. Mg can also be co-precipitated in the form of amorphous Mg phosphate, and the precipitation of Fe sulphate is also possible. The process is driven by hydrolysis and oxidation of Fe2+, followed by charge neutralization and flocculation with carboxylic acids, phenols and colloidal species, which are abundant in HTC process water. In addition, a decrease in phosphorus content was observed, which is most likely due to the formation of precipitates in the form of phosphates, as Fe and other ions such as Ca and Mg can react with phosphates and form precipitates [36]. An additional FTIR analysis of the precipitated particles was also performed (Figure S1b). The FTIR spectra of the particles show broad O–H stretching bands around ~3218 cm−1, confirming the presence of hydroxyl groups. Strong absorptions at ~1038 cm−1 and 791–611 cm−1 can be assigned to P–O stretching vibrations of phosphate groups, while the bands at ~530 cm−1

Another reaction pathway for N conversion involves further photoreduction of nitrate to nitrite or N2. The same reaction pathways were previously noticed by Ortiz-Marin et al.
