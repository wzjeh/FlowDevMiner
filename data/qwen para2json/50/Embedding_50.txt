Recently, microchannel reactors have been utilized for produc- ing nano-sized particles, including metals and alloys [13–18], me- tal salts [19,20], metal oxides [21], polymers [22], mesoporous materials [23], and zeolites [24]. The flow type microchannel reac- tors are able to intensify the mass and heat transfers as well as the mixing. The high surface-to-volume ratio in the microchannel reactors is favorable to enhance the response time and maintain isothermal conditions. Because the concentrations of reactants and temperature are homogeneous in the reaction zone, the ob- tained particles are uniform and reproducible.

When a single phase is involved, the velocity distribution in a microchannel is substantially broadened along the flow direction. Gunther et al. [25] compared the well mixing efficiency chaotic mixer with a liquid–liquid two phase mixer, and found that, when the fluid was mixed completely (P95%), the length of the channel required for the two-phase flow was 2–3 times shorter than for the single-phase flow. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simula- tions indicate that the enhancement of mass transfer can be inter- preted in terms of an internal circulation flow within the plugs. As a consequence, narrow particle size distribution could be obtained in the synthesis of nanoparticles due to the enhanced mixing and the narrow residence time distribution in the segmented liquid–li- quid flow [26]. Another important issue in the synthesis of solid materials in a microchannel is that the formed particles may nucle- ate and deposit on the microchannel walls, leading to runaway growth, clogging, and unstable reactor conditions. Jongen et al. [27] designed a complex liquid–liquid two phase slug-flow mic- roreactor, which included an aqueous phase of the two reactants and an oil phase. The immiscible oil phase isolated the aqueous phase in droplets. Nanoparticles nucleate and grow in the isolated droplets, whereas the droplets will not contact with the micro- channel walls when the oil-to-water volume ratio is carefully ad- justed in a suitable range, preventing the solid particles from depositing on the walls.

Zn(NO3)2 was used as the Zn2+ source, and the concentrations of Zn(NO3)2 and NaOH were 0.5 and 1.0 mol/L, respectively. The syn- thesis was conducted at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min and various tem- peratures (40, 50, 60, and 70 �C). It is known that high temperature may lead to de-emulsification. To ensure that no de-emulsification occurred in the temperature range, M(NaOH) and M(Zn(NO3)2) were fed separately into the microreactor system at the same flow- rate as in the synthesis runs. No de-emulsification of either M(NaOH) and M(Zn(NO3)2) was observed, indicating that both microemulsions were stable under the synthesis conditions. The XRD patterns of ZnO nanoparticles synthesized at different tem- peratures are shown in Fig. 8. Pure ZnO nanocrystals were obtained in the temperature range investigated. Fig. 9 displays the variation of the average particle size with reaction temperature. A minimum average particle size (10.4 nm) was observed at 50 �C when increasing the reaction temperature from 40 to 70 �C. At low tem- peratures, the formation rate of the precipitated precursor was low, and thus the supersaturation degree was low, which was unfavorable to the nucleation but favorable to the growth of the

To clarify the role of the micromixer in the synthesis, the micromixer was replaced by a T-joint (inner diameter of the pipes: 2 mm) in the continuous synthesis system. The size distribution of the obtained ZnO nanoparticles was compared with those of the particles synthesized in the microreator and in the batch reactor (Fig. 12). It is apparent that the micromixer significantly reduced the particle size and improved the size distribution of ZnO nanoparticles.

The microreactor for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles is illus- trated in Fig. 2. The micromixer (CPMM-R 300, microchannel size: 300 � 300 lm, Mainz, Germany) and the relay tube (stainless steel, i.d. 6.35 mm � 1.0 m) were immersed in an oil thermostat, whose temperature was adjusted by a temperature controller. M(Zn2+) and M(NaOH) were fed separately to the two inlets of the microm- ixer by two syringe HPLC pumps. At a steady state, a white suspen- sion was obtained at the outlet of the relay tube. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 4000 r/min for 10 min, and washed with ethanol, acetone, and water sequentially for three

the synthesis reaction is substantially fast. However, the reduced residence time at high flow rate might be not long enough for the completion of the precipitate crystallization. The crystalliza- tion might continue to take place in the collection container at the outlet of the reaction system, leading to the formation of larger particles.

concentration, whereas a minimum average particle size was ob- served 50 �C when the reaction temperature was increased from 40 to 70 �C. The feed flow rate did not affect considerably the aver- age particle size of ZnO nanoparticles. However, at high flow rates, larger particles were obtained, probably because the crystallization might continue after the droplets had left the reaction system. This may imply that the crystallization step was slower that the synthe- sis reaction.

In the precipitation of Zn(OH)2, the reaction rate depends on both the Zn2+ concentration and reaction temperature from the viewpoint of reaction kinetics. The effects of Zn2+ concentration were investigated in the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles from ZnSO4 and Zn(NO3)2. The reaction conditions were as follows: feed flow rates of M(Zn2+) and M(NaOH), 2.0 mL/min, respectively; tem- perature, 50 �C; NaOH/Zn2+ molar ratio, 2.0; pressure, 2.0 MPa. The Zn2+ concentration was varied in the range of 0.3–0.8 mol/L. Fig. 6 illustrates the XRD patterns of ZnO nanoparticles synthesized at various concentrations of ZnSO4 and Zn(NO3)2. Only hexagonal crystalline phase was detectable in each sample, regardless of the Zn2+ sources and their concentrations. The dependence of the aver- age particle size on the Zn2+ source and concentration is illustrated in Fig. 7. As shown in Fig. 5, the Zn2+ source significantly affected the particle size of the obtained ZnO nanoparticles. The average sizes of ZnO nanoparticles synthesized from ZnSO4 were 1.2–1.3 times those of the nanoparticles from Zn(NO3)2 at the same Zn2+

ZnO nanoparticles synthesized from microemulsions in a con- tinuous microreactor were smaller in grain size and more narrowly distributed than those in a batch reactor. The microemulsions pro- vide confined space for the reactants, which is favorable for con- trollable reaction and nucleation, avoiding the formation of large particles. In addition, the microemulsions prevent the deposition of ZnO particles on the wall of the microchannels of the reactor,

In the microchannel reaction system, three phases are involved in the reaction: droplets of M(Zn2+) and droplets of M(NaOH) dis- persed in the organic phase (Fig. 3). A prerequisite in the synthesis reaction is the merging of one droplet of M(Zn2+) with the one of M(NaOH). In the present study, M(Zn2+) and M(NaOH) were pre- pared under identical conditions with the same aqueous solution content. Fig. 4 shows the photos of the aqueous droplets in M(NaOH) and in M(Zn(NO3)2). The droplets in both M(NaOH) and M(Zn(NO3)2) were well dispersed in the oil phases. The diameters of the droplets were measured in the photos, and the average sizes of droplets were calculated. The average size of the droplets in M(NaOH) (1.2 lm) was comparable to that in M(Zn(NO3)2) (1.4 lm). When M(NaOH) and M(Zn(NO3)2) were fed by two sepa- rate syringe pumps, the droplets of M(Zn2+) and M(NaOH) were passed through the microchannels of the micromixer alternatingly in most cases. When the droplet of M(Zn2+) collides with the one of M(NaOH), a merging of the droplets may take place, leading to the formation of a larger droplet. It is in this merged droplet that Zn2+

Synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles from microemulsions in a flow type microreactor

The microemulsion has found great applications in the synthe- sis of nanomaterials [10–12]. In the microemulsion approach, the reactants in aqueous solution are confined in the extremely small droplets, in which a uniform nucleation occurs. Additionally, the microemulsion helps to control the size and shape of the particles, preventing the nanoparticles from aggregation. Nevertheless, the microemulsion method suffers from low yield of nanoparticles and the difficulty of de-emulsification. As a consequence, the

Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were synthesized from microemulsions in a microchannel reactor system. The microemulsions provide confined space for the reactants, which is favorable for controllable reaction and nucleation, thus avoiding the formation of large particles. In addition, the microemulsions prevent the deposition of ZnO particles on the wall of the microchannels of the reactor. Three Zn2+ sources (Zn(NO3)2, ZnSO4, and ZnCl2) were tested in the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles. Among them, Zn(NO3)2 showed best performance, yielding ZnO particles with the smallest average grain size. The effects of Zn2+
