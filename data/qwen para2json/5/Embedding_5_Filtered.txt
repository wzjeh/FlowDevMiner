The microchannel was fabricated from Plexiglas with a depth, width, and length of 0.9, 1 and 70 mm, respectively. The cover plate of microreactor was made from quartz plate. The fabricated microchannel is shown in Fig. 2.

in which abs0 and abs1 are the absorbances of DR16 in aqueous solution at the initial condition and the outlet stream, respectively. It should be noticed that abs0 is the absorbance of diluted DR 16, by considering the amount of H2O2 solution (water + H2O2) fed to the reactor. In other words, by the calculation of amount of material entered via H2O2 solution, the initial dye was diluted with water and its absorbance was mea- sured and called abs0. In this study, the effects of different parameters over decolorization efficiency were investigated. Examined range is given in Table 1. All experiments were conducted at 25˚C. In all experiments, in order to be sure that the mea- sured concentrations are in steady state condition, all samplings were done after 2 min as it was found that during this time, the system reached to steady state condition for all feed flow rate. The minimum and maximum residence times in the range of this study were 0.5 and 4.2 s, respectively. In order to illustrate this point, an example of unsteady state test for feed flow rate of 3 ml/min is shown in Fig. 5. It should be mentioned that the residence time of reactant for this layout in the microchannel was about 1.5 s and entire time required for analysis was almost 10 s.

concentrations; solution pH; and feed flow rates on the decolorization efficiency under contin- uous conditions, has been studied. The results showed that at pH values between 3 and 4, more DR16 vanished from feed stream. Moreover, higher decolorization efficiencies were obtained at higher Fe2+ and H2O2 concentrations as well as lower dye concentration and feed flow rate. The results indicated that it is possible to reach an efficiency of 86% for DR16 dye decolorization in just 4.2 s, as residence time, using this microreactor. This was obtained due to efficient reactants mixing in the microreactor mixing point. This study illustrates the advan- tage of using microreactors for continuous flow decolorization process in the comparison with conventional use of batch stirred tank reactors.

dyes. They studied continuous decolorization of sev- eral dyes in a bubble reactor. Their experiments revealed that with a residence time of 21 h, about 80% of color removal was achieved. Microreactors are novel reactors with a channel hydraulic diameter of equal or less than 1 mm [22,23]. Microreactors have interesting characteristics such as their small size, fast responding, and their flexibility with low capital and operating cost. It is anticipated that traditional pilot plants may be replaced by these systems. Among the reported studies in literature, Burns and Ramshaw [24] investigated the nitration of benzene in the presence of the H2SO4 catalyst in a T-shaped mic- roreactor with a diameter of 127 lm. Their results showed that decreasing in the microchannel diameter led to a considerable reduction in corresponding byproduct (di-nitrobenzene) concentration due to more efficient mixing. In another study, Lindstrom et al. [25] introduced a microreactor with walls coated with TiO2 nanoparticles. They studied photo degradation of Methlyne Blue with air-saturated in the presence of excess oxygen. The degradation rate enhanced signifi- cantly with the addition of oxygen. However, the author reported that it could operate for more than 1,000 h without any reduction in performance. In another work, Gao et al. [26] reported ozonation of synthetic wastewater containing Azo dye Acid Red 14 (AR 14) in a high-throughput microporous tube-in- tube microchannel reactor. Their results showed that with increase in ozone gas flow rate, simultaneous decrease in the liquid flow rate, and initial AR 14 con- centration, the decolorization efficiency was enhanced significantly. In another research, Matsushita et al. [27] made a photo catalytic microreactor to reduce organic content of an aqueous solution. The microreactor was coated with a layer of TiO2 catalyst. They reached to a yield of 92.5% in the best condition. The aim of the present study is to introduce a novel method for using microreactors in a continuous flow decolorization process. Fenton reaction is a fast reaction. However, long process times, in order of 30 min, were reported for employed conventional batch systems for this reaction [17,28]. This time is called mixing time, which is the time needed by reac- tants to find each others. Decreasing the treatment time in the proposed continuous systems is the main feature of this study. For this purpose, decolorization of DR16 by Fenton process was investigated. Experi- ments were conducted in a continuous Y-shaped mic- roreactor in which the Fenton degradation of Azo dye was taken place. The two streams of solution (Azo dye and ferrous sulfate) and H2O2 continuously were

In the peresent work, the effect of the influent flow rate on decolorization of DR16 was investigated. The revealed results in Fig. 9 indicate that at a fixed con- centration of Fe2+, increase in the feed flow rate led to a significant reduction in the decolorization effiecency. This may be explained by a decrease in the reactor residence time. In other words, with increase in feed flow rate, less time is available for ferrous ions to react with hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals and consequent dye/hydroxyl radical reac- tion. For instance, at Fe2+ concentration of 1 ppm, increase in feed flow rate from 1 to 8 ml/min reduced the decolorization efficiency from 64 to 44%. The flow rate of 1 ml/min was obtained as the best value for this purpose.

that the decolorization efficiency reduced when the concentration of dye and/or flow rate of reactants increased. In general, it can be concluded that the Fenton process in microchannel is quite useful to promote decolorization of DR16. High decolorization efficiency, about 86%, was obtained in the studied microreactor, which promises a new technique with high decolor- ization efficiency for wastewater treatment. One of the main advantages of the proposed system is reputabil- ity in scale-up for industrial purposes. For higher treatment load, the proposed microreactor can be used in a parallel cascade layout.

diverted to the reactor. After the feed streams passed through the microreactor, the treated effluent was ana- lyzed using an UV/V. The influences of different parameters, including H2O2, Fe2+, and DR16 concen- trations; solution pH; and flow rates of feed streams in DR16 oxidation, were investigated.

A schematic diagram of the experimental setup illustrated in Fig. 3. A peristaltic pump (QIS�, DSP100) diverted the feeds through the Y-shaped microchannel. The required amount of FeSO4·7H2O was added into the dye solution and then the solution pH was adjusted. Both feeds flow rates were measured using two separate flow meters. Samples were collected from the microreactor output stream. A UV spectrophotometer from UNIC Company was used to analyze the samples. The absorption spectrum of DR16 solution was examined to determine the wave-

The results in Fig. 9 reveal that at a constant flow rate, the decolorization efficiency was improved with increase in ferrous concentration. From this figure, it can be seen that at the lowest flow rate, increase in ferrous concentration from 0.5 to 2 ppm caused a sig- nificant improvement in the decolorization efficiency from 42 to 79%. However, at the same condition, an extra addition of this agent from 2 to 4 ppm improved the color removal only by 6% (from 79 to 85%). There- fore, the ferrous concentration of 1 mg/l was treated as the best value in the range of studied concentra- tions. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that increase in ferrous concentration increases decolorization efficiency. How- ever, there is no direct proportionality between ferrous concentration and the decolorization efficiency. The results show that the decolorization efficiency became almost double with eight-time increase in the ferrous concentration. This can be explained by Fen- ton reaction and rapid H2O2 to OH conversion, described in Eq. (1). However, it can be seen that rate of increase in decolorization efficiency decreases gradually at higher Ferrous concentration.

Using Y-shaped microreactor for continuous decolorization of an Azo dye

In Fig. 6, the effect of pH on the decolorization efficiency of DR16 by Fenton process is illustrated. As shown in this figure, the value of proper pH is about 3.5 and by changing this value, the decolorization effi- ciency decreased. The results clearly indicated that at low pH (less than 3), the decolorization efficiency is between 22 and 26% at various flow rates. From these results, it can be seen that at pH higher than efficient value, the decolorization efficiency decreased again for all examined flow rates. In the reported studies in literature [29–31], pH close to 3 is usually suggested as the best condition for Fenton oxidation process. The obtained results from this study are also in agreement with this suggestion.

This study reports the decolorization of an Azo dye (DR16) in a Y-shaped microreactor using Fenton process. The effect of important operation parameters, including dye, H2O2, and Fe2+

Most of reported studies on using Fenton process were carried out in batch reactors [17]. However, a few works were reported in which the wastewater was decolorized in continuous processes. Merzouk et al. [18] used continuous electro-coagulation for decolor- ization of a synthetic textile wastewater by aluminum electrodes. They investigated the effect of some param- eters such as residence time, influent of pH, and inlet dye concentration on the decolorization process. A decolorization efficiency of 85% of red dye in 14 min was reported by the authors. In another study, Li and Jia [19] designed a packed-bed bioreactor for continu- ous decolorization of synthetic dyes using rice hull- Schizophyllum sp. F17. The decolorization process was carried out in two steps and the decolorization efficien- cies of 89.71 and 60.44% at dye concentrations of 142.63 and 110.7 mg/l were reported. However, the reported reaction times were 41 and 29.4 h, respec- tively, for these dye concentrations. On the other hand, several studies were reported in which Fenton process was performed in continuous flow reactors. Monteagudo et al. [20] utilized a specific continuous reactor (compound parabolic collector) with air injection for photo-Fenton degradation of the non-biodegradable dye (Reactive Blue 4). In another study, Rosales et al. [21] used a combined technique of the Electro-Fenton process to remove synthetic
