The microreactor is equipped with three inlet ports for H2, O2, and the solvent, a single outlet port, a gas−liquid mixing zone, a packed bed section, and six DAMS units to prevent catalyst backflow into the gas−liquid mixing zone and out of the microreactor. The width of the gas−liquid inlet is 200 μm, with a depth of 250 μm. The gas mixing channel and the filler bed channel, both 800 μm in depth and width, are interconnected by a dam measuring 2000 μm in length, 800 μm in width, and 100 μm in depth. The dam, which is smaller than the catalyst particles, is positioned at the entrance of the catalyst inlet to prevent backflow of catalyst particles into the gas mixing zone during filling. Additionally, five dams of identical size are situated at the outlet to trap any catalyst particles. The fluid flow rate is controlled by a high-precision injection pump (LD-P2020, Shanghai Lande Medical Instruments Co., Ltd., China) in conjunction with a 30 mL syringe (BD Plastic, Jiangxi Fenglin Medical Instruments Co., Ltd., China). The gas flow rate is regulated by a mass flow controller (MFC model CS200A, Beijing Seven Star Huachuang Electronics Co., Ltd., China). Prior to use, nitrogen (N2) is employed to test the microreactor for leaks. Following this, the reaction mixture (CH3OH + H2SO4 + NaBr) undergoes acidification for 30 min. Subsequently, H2 at a flow rate of 2.88 mL min−1 and O2 at a flow rate of 4.12 mL min−1 are introduced into the system for the reaction. Meanwhile, N2 flows directly into the H2O2 collection vessel at a rate of 10 mL min−1, serving as a protective gas. The flow rate of the tail gas was measured using a precision molding flowmeter, and the concentrations of H2 and O2 in the tail gas were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC- 7820). A Teflon tube served as the connecting conduit, and the reaction occurred under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. The concentration of H2O2 in the reaction medium was determined by iodometric titration. Using this data, the H2 conversion (%), H2O2 selectivity (%), and H2O2 yield (g kgcat −1 h−1) of the catalyst were calculated according to eqs 1, 2, and 3.

However, the reaction must be conducted under a high pressure ranging from 2 to 3 MPa, which imposes stricter demands on the material selection for the microreactor. Kanungo et al. immobilized Au Pd nanoparticles on the inner wall of the channel within the microreactor for DSHP, enabling the synthesis of H2O2 at a concentration of 1.8 wt %.35 Since the catalyst is immobilized on the inner wall of the channel in the microreactor, its deactivation necessitates replacing the entire microreactor, which incurs prohibitively high costs. Yang et al. designed a microreactor for the synthesis of H2O2 at a concentration of 0.388 wt % under normal pressure. The continuous flow operation minimized the contact time between H2O2 and the catalyst, thereby reducing the decomposition of H2O2 induced by the catalyst. Consequently, the produced H2O2 could be utilized directly without further processing.36 However, the concentration of H2O2 generated remains relatively low. Therefore, it is essential to develop microreactors capable of continuously producing high-concentration H2O2 under normal temperature and pressure conditions, thereby enabling low-cost, on-site production and facilitating the industrial implementation of DSHP. In summary, this paper describes the independent design and fabrication of a microreactor for use as a DSHP reactor, utilizing LA-functionalized Pd−Ni catalyst and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as key materials. The impact of Ni doped and LA-functionalized Pd catalysts on the selectivity, yield, and concentration of H2O2 was investigated through experimental methods, DFT calculations, and comprehensive studies. The conclusions of this study offer valuable insights and serve as a reference for the future design and development of catalysts and microreactors. ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Hydrogenation and decomposition experiments of the catalysts were conducted in the aforementioned microreactor using the same reaction medium, supplemented with 200.0 μL of a 30.0 wt % H2O2 solution. Hydrogenation experiments were conducted under H2 and N2 atmospheres with flow rates of 2.88 mL min−1 and 10.0 mL min−1, respectively. For the decomposition experiment, only N2 (10.0 mL min−1) was injected. The H2O2 hydrogenation or decomposition rate of the catalyst (g kgcat −1 h−1) was calculated by eq 4.

The irreversible dissociation of the O−O bond in species such as O2*, OOH*, and HOOH* is primarily attributed to the electron transfer from the active component of the Pd catalyst to these adsorbed species at the active site. This process is the main reason for the decrease in H2O2 selectivity and yield.15 To suppress the dissociation of O−O bonds and enhance the yield and selectivity of H2O2, a secondary metal is commonly incorporated into Pd-based catalysts to improve their catalytic performance. Common combinations include Pd−Pt,16 Pd−Au,17 Pd−Ag18 among others. By modulating the electronic structure of Pd through the incorporation of precious metals and effectively suppressing the dissociation of O−O bonds, the yield and selectivity of H2O2 production can be significantly enhanced. However, the incorporation of precious metals is prohibitively expensive and poses significant challenges for industrial application. Therefore, it is essential for DSHP to modulate the electronic structure of Pd by incorporating nonprecious metals, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of the catalyst, suppressing O−O bond dissociation, improving the yield and selectivity of H2O2

production, and reducing costs. For instance, Pd−Sn,19 Pd− Sb,20 Pd−Co,21 Pd−Ga and Pd−In.22 Although the incorpo- ration of these nonprecious metals successfully suppressed the dissociation of O−O bonds, it only enhanced either the yield, selectivity, or concentration of H2O2, or the conversion rate of H2, but not all of them simultaneously. Existing studies have demonstrated that incorporating Ni into Pd-based catalysts can substantially enhance the yield, selectivity, and stability of H2O2 production. Maity et al. incorporated Ni into the Pd- based catalyst, achieving a selectivity as high as 95% for H2O2 production. The catalytic activity of the Ni−Pd catalyst was 3- fold higher than that of the single Pd catalyst. Moreover, the Ni−Pd catalyst exhibited excellent stability under harsh conditions, even in the presence of HCl and Br−.23 Feng et al. doped Ni into the material, achieving high catalytic activity, excellent selectivity and stability, as well as effectively suppressing H2O2 decomposition.24 The incorporation of Ni effectively modulates the electronic structure of Pd, suppresses O−O bond dissociation, and significantly enhances the catalytic activity, stability, yield, and selectivity for H2O2 production. Given its abundant reserves, Ni serves as an ideal nonprecious metal dopant for Pd-based catalysts. In recent years, the application of ligands to modulate the electronic structure of Pd and suppress O−O bond dissociation has significantly enhanced the yield and selectivity of H2O2 production, as well as the activity and stability of the catalyst.25−27 The electronic structure of Pd was modified through the introduction of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), resulting in the production of 5442.35 g kgcat −1 h−1 of H2O2.28

ABSTRACT: Using an L-arginine (LA)-functionalized Pd−Ni catalyst, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was directly synthesized via a self-designed microreactor at ambient temperature and pressure. The yield of H2O2 achieved 574.31g kgcat −1

Cycle experiment: The 20 mg catalyst was put into the microreactor, acidified with the reaction solution at 25 °C for 30 min, and then injected with H2 (2.88 mL min−1) and O2 (4.12 mL min−1) for reaction, and N2 (10 mL min−1) was directly injected into the H2O2 collection bottle as a protective gas. The concentrations of H2 and O2 in the tail gas were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC-7820), while the yield and concentration of H2O2 in the reaction medium were determined through iodometric titration. After the reaction, the catalyst recovered from the microreactor was sequentially washed, filtered to neutrality, and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h. The dried catalyst was subsequently weighed, and the next cycle of experiments was initiated. DFT Calculation. All periodic spin-polarized DFT calculations were conducted using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package

As a crucial green chemical, H2O2 has found extensive applications in pulp bleaching, wastewater treatment, the textile industry, chemical synthesis, metallurgy, aerospace, and the electronics sector. Consequently, the demand for H2O2 has been increasing annually.1−3 Currently, over 95% of global H2O2 production relies on the anthraquinone process (AO). However, this method has notable drawbacks, including substantial capital investment requirements, significant envi- ronmental pollution, and elevated risks associated with the transportation of high-concentration H2O2.4−6 Simultaneously, over two-thirds of H2O2 applications require concentrations of less than 9 wt %.7,8 Therefore, it is imperative to develop an economically viable, environmentally friendly, safe, and readily available method to replace the AO-based production of H2O2. The direct synthesis of H2O2 (DSHP) from hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) using Pd as the active component at room temperature represents a promising alternative to the AO process for H2O2 production. This method offers several advantages, including atomic economy, the use of environ- mentally benign solvents such as methanol or water, the absence of hazardous organic compounds, suitability for small- scale production, and ease of integration with downstream processes.9−11 However, the primary limitation of the DSHP process lies in the suboptimal catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of the Pd catalyst, which significantly hinders its industrial application. Therefore, conducting research on the rational design and controllable preparation of Pd catalysts

the direct mixing of H2 and O2.32 It is widely favored by numerous researchers in the DSHP field. For instance, the Inoue research group successfully employed microreactors in DSHP, enabling safe and direct mixing of H2 and O2 within the explosive limit, ensuring proper gas−liquid distribution, and achieving the synthesis of H2O2 at a higher concentration.32−34

to neutrality, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain Pd-Ni/AC-LA (Ni:Pd = 0.1, LA = 10 mg). Additionally, Pd/AC, Pd/ AC-LA (LA = 10 mg), and Pd-Ni/AC (Ni:Pd = 0.1) were prepared using the same procedure. Pd-Ni/AC (Ni:Pd = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.14) series catalysts were prepared by varying the Ni content. Additionally, Pd-Ni/AC-LA catalysts (Ni:Pd = 0.10, LA = 5, 15, 20, and 25 mg) were synthesized to investigate the effects of Ni/Pd ratio and LA loading on H2O2 yield. The metal content of the prepared catalyst was quantified by ICP-MS, and the results were in good agreement with the theoretically calculated molar ratios of Pd and Ni (Table S1). Catalyst Characterization. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20, Thermo Fisher, USA) was employed to characterize the morphology of the catalyst and determine the particle size of the active components. Physical adsorption instrument (BET, Micrometrics ASAP 2020, McKesson Corporation, USA) was used to study the specific surface area (SBET), pore volume and pore size distribution of carbon carriers. The surface composition and chemical state of the catalyst were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha Plus, Thermo Fisher, USA). The functional groups of the catalysts were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet iS50, Thermo Fisher, USA). Raman spectrometers (Raman, LabRAM Aramis, France) were employed to characterize the degree of graphitization and defect density of the carbon carriers. The crystal phase of the catalyst was determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany). The adsorption capacities of H2 and O2 were investigated using a chemical adsorption analyzer (TPD, Auto Chem II 2920, Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA). The Pd and Ni content in the catalysts was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, PerkinElmer, USA). Comprehensive Evaluation of Catalytic Performance. The microreactor comprises a PMMA substrate (40.5 mm × 60.5 mm × 3.8 mm) featuring all microchannels and inlet/outlet ports (diameter: 1.3 mm), along with a Teflon sheet serving as a gasket. All microchannels on the PMMA substrate are precisely machined and engraved using a CNC machine (Seiken Instruments Desktop CNC 3040). The machined PMMA sheets, along with Teflon sheets, are then assembled onto a custom fixture equipped with connecting fittings for attachment to external piping, as illustrated in Figure 2.

investigate the side reactions of hydrogenation and decom- position on the catalyst. As illustrated in Figure 5(f), the Pd- Ni/AC-LA catalyst exhibited the lowest rates of hydrogenation and decomposition, suggesting that the dual modification through Ni doping and LA-functionalization effectively minimized the hydrogenation and decomposition rates of H2O2. The impact of reaction time on H2O2 yield was systematically investigated. As illustrated in Figure 5(g), the yield of H2O2 for all catalysts progressively increased with extended reaction time before reaching a plateau. Notably, the Pd-Ni/AC-LA catalyst exhibited the highest H2O2 yield. The results demonstrate that Ni doping and LA-functionalization are essential for the dual modification. Utilizing a microreactor can effectively minimize the contact time between H2O2 and the catalyst, thereby reducing the decomposition of H2O2. After five cycles of experiments, the Pd-Ni/AC-LA catalyst maintains high activity, as illustrated in Figure 5(h). This suggests that the dual modification through Ni doping and LA- functionalization significantly enhances both the stability and regenerability of the catalyst.
