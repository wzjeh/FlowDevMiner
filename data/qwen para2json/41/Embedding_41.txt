The microreactor system improved some of the fixed bed deficiencies as low heat transfer rates [11]. Furthermore, the WHSV values used were appropriate for the microreactor system but no for the fixed bed reactor system. Considering that the dilution also affected the microreactors, the measured conversions were much higher than the ones measured in the fixed bed reactor.

2.2.1. The microreactor A reactor for hydrogen production from natural gas was designed focussing on avoiding internal and external mass-transfer resistances. As it can be observed in Fig. 2, the platelets are composed by 14 microchannels which were fabricated with 500 mm � 250 mm (width � depth) dimensions. The microreactors were made of stainless-steel with the next composition: 53.22% Fe, 24.21% Cr, 19.09% Ni, 1.97% Si, 1.43% Mn, 0.05% C, 0.02% Pb and 0.001% S (wt.). The impregnated catalyst particle size must be small enough for the deposition and fixing in the channels as well as for the reduction of internal mass-transfer resistance. The external mass-transfer resistance was studied trough Mears criteria [16]. Moreover, the microreactors were modelled using Aspen Plus commercial software for the process analysis. All the experimental conditions were analyzed and simulated before the operation in the laboratory [17,18].

2.2.2. Fixed bed reactor As a traditional reactor system a stainless-steel fixed bed reactor (1.15 cm i.d. and 30 cm length) was used. The same amount of catalyst than in the microreactors was used.

experimental conditions really low conversions were ach- ieved; for every S/C ratios the achieved methane conversion was under 5%. The results of conversion for natural gas SR were also insignificant, only hydrocarbons like propane and butane had high conversions. As a summary, conversions far from the maximum equilibrium values were obtained operating with micro- reactors and no significant conversions were obtained in the fixed bed reaction system. This difference indicates the advantages of microreactor systems. For all catalysts and both reaction systems the calculated element balances errors were small and as a result coking rates were quite low.

case of increasing the S/C ratio from 1.5 to 2.0, it can be observed that methane conversion remained with similar values for the first hours (marked with a circle) and after that, the methane conversion lowered to 54.02%. In these first hours, the CO selectivity decreased from a 71% to a 59% and also the hydrogen yield. As methane conversion did not change, this effect could be explained through the promotion of the WGS reaction. For these experiments, significant deactivation of the catalysts was not observed. As a summary, it could be affirm that increasing the S/C ratio the conversion and hydrogen yield improved, for the S/C from 1.0 to 1.5, and as it should be expected. Nevertheless, for the highest ratio, S/ C ¼ 2.0, the activity did not improve. Natural gas SR activity tests were also carried out using the Ni/MgO catalyst. As it can be observed in Fig. 4, the measured conversion for hydrocarbons was higher than for methane. The conversion of this latter remained almost constant when the S/C ratio was increased up to 2, but it was lower for ethane, propane and butane. However, hydrogen generation remained constant because of WGS reaction. In these exper- iments catalyst did not suffer deactivation.

a. Catalyst preparation: An IKA mill was used for the reduc- tion of the catalysts particle size. Once powdered the catalysts were sieved with a 75-mm sieve. b. Microreactor preparation: The microreactors were intro- duced in an ultrasonic bath with isopropanol during 10 min for channel cleaning. After drying, they were calcined at 1273 K during 4 h. c. Catalyst impregnation: A liquid phase suspension which ensures a perfect adhesion between catalysts and micro- channels was prepared for the impregnation. Catalysts were manually impregnated filling microchannels with suspension and removing the excess. d. Conditioning of catalyst and microreactor: After impreg- nation, the catalysts were calcined at 1073 K during 2 h under oxidative conditions. Finally, the platelets were welded and the microreactors conditioned for using them in the activity tests.

Hydrogen production from methane and natural gas steam reforming process was studied by two different reaction systems at the same conditions. Higher methane (or NG) conversion was reached at higher temperatures but it does not improve significantly operating at higher steam to carbon ratios. In the case of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, high methane and natural gas conversions were ob- tained despite of its quick deactivation. On the contrary, Ni/ MgO catalyst did not suffer apparent deactivation and it reached the highest hydrogen production at 1073 K and S/C of 1.5 for SMR reaction. In this case, the Water Gas Shift reaction is also promoted. For Pt/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, the ob- tained low catalytic activity might be due to the bad impreg- nation and the carbon filaments growth. For all the catalysts, lower conversion was reached in a fixed bed reactor at the same WHSV. Thus, higher hydro- carbons conversions and higher hydrogen yields were ach- ieved in the microreactors. As a result, decentralized hydrogen production from NG SR through process intensification (heat and mass transfer) seems to be a promising technology. In a near future, these systems could be used together with other renewable feeds, such as biogas and bioalcohols, for the production of either chemicals or fuels with high added value.

3.2.1. Microreactor 1: Ni/MgO catalyst Experiments at different temperatures confirmed that as SMR reaction is endothermic, the lowest activity was measured at the lowest temperature, 973 K, (about 35% of methane conversion). Increasing the reaction temperature higher methane conversion was reached. During these experiments no significant deactivation of the catalyst was observed for the time on stream. Results of the activity tests at 1073 K and different S/C ratios are shown in Fig. 3 for the Ni/MgO catalyst. The S/C ratio of 1.0 corresponds to the stoichiometric feed for the SMR reaction. Experiments in which more water was added than the required for this stoichiometric reaction were carried out at S/C ¼ 1.5 and 2.0. For the Ni/MgO catalyst at 1073 K, and S/C ratio of 1.0, the methane conversion was about 55%. When the ratio of S/C was increased from 1 to 1.5 methane conversions grew from a 55.00% to a 60.52% increasing also the hydrogen yield. In the

3.2.3. Microreactor 3&4: Pd and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts For Pt/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, methane and natural gas SR activity tests were also carried out at 1073 K and S/C ¼ 1.0. Unfortunately, no significant conversion (under 5%) was measured for methane. For the other hydrocarbons less than 5% of conversion was also reached, which means that for those catalysts hydrogen production was really low.

The effluent stream was cooled down with a partial condenser. The condensed water was collected and weighted, and the gas phase was analyzed by a Gas Chromatograph (GC 6890 N) equipped with FID and TCD detectors. Two columns, HP Plot Q and HP Molsiv, were used in a series/bypass arrangement for the complete separation of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, methane, ethane, propane and butane. Before running the activity tests, each catalyst was reduced at 1073 K, using 360 NmL/min of a 3:1 N2:H2 mixture, during 4 h for all the reaction systems. The measured parameters were defined as:
