intensification technology for a broad range of reaction processes in laboratory and industry. The features of microreactors such as larger surface-to-volume ratio, higher mixing efficiency, faster heat and mass transfer rates, and excellent spatiotemporal control, allow reaction processes to overcome the transport limitation and thus to have better performance (e.g., higher selectivity and yield)

2.2.2. Synthesis of homoarm star polymers in the cascade microreactor system Typically, for the synthesis of PBA homoarm star polymer (SPB) with the molar ratio of [BA]0/[DoPAT]0/[HDDA]0 = 100/1/10, the mixture of BA (2.5 M, 100 eq), DoPAT (0.025 M, 1eq), ABVN (2.5 mM, 0.1eq) and DMF were used to prepare linear arms. HDDA (0.5 M) dissolved in DMF and ABVN (0.01 M) dissolved in DMF were ready for t

2.2.1. Synthesis of linear polymers in the microreactor Typically, for the synthesis of linear PBA, a homogeneous solution was obtained by adding the monomer BA (2.5 M, 100 eq), the RAFT agent DoPAT(1 eq), the initiator ABVN (0.1 eq) and the solvent DMF into a dried flask sealed with a rubber septum, and then was purged with N2 for 30 min. A capillary microreactor with 1.02 mL inner volume was flu

feedstocks (both at the flow rate of 0.51 mL/h) mixed with the stream of synthesized linear polymers through two micromixers, so the concen- trations of reactants were diluted according to their flow rate ratio (Fig. S1). The newly combined stream was delivered into a second capillary microreactor with 4.08 mL for the star formation step, at a residence time τ2 of 2 h (total flow rate of 2.04 mL/h

We first investigated the continuous-flow preparation of linear arms. BA and ACMO were selected as target monomers because their corre- sponding polymer chains were respectively hydrophobic and hydro- philic, which could be used to fabricate miktoarm star polymers. The highly active initiator ABVN was selected to ensure fast reaction rates as to avoid long reaction time. By adjusting the feed flow

3.2.4. Kinetics of the coupling reaction in the cascade microreactor system Moreover, in the second step of the cascade microreactor system, we used l-PACMO with the chain length of nearly 40 as an example to study the coupling reaction kinetics from linear macromolecules to star shaped macromolecules. The flow rate of the combined stream was maintained constant, and τ2 was controlled by adjusting

Accordingly, the GPC trace of the product moved slightly to a high MW region. Similar to Gao's report for preparing star polymers [39], the procedure of linear chains purification was omitted in our cascade microreactor system. Strictly speaking, the core was a copolymer of the cross-linker and the unreacted monomer. Such a structure could decrease the core's steric congestion, hence facilitating

With the RAFT arm-first method, butyl acrylate and 4-acryloylmorpholine were used as monomers to form linear arms, which subsequently reacted with the cross-linker 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate to form star-shaped macro- molecules in cascade microreactor systems. After studying polymerization kinetics in each step, homoarm and miktoarm star products with various arm compositions were steadily prepared

3.2.2. Effect of the mixing performance The mixing process between polymer segments with fresh monomers was reported to remarkably influence the MWDs in chain extension re- actions [36,37]. Laminar flow profiles with low Reynolds numbers were obtained in our system, and the mixing process of different streams was dominated by the molecular diffusion [38], which could be enhanced by pre-mixing or u

In this work, through combining the RAFT arm-first approach and microreactor technology, we succeeded in preparing star polymers with varied chain compositions in homemade cascade microreactor systems. First, the polymerization kinetics in the arm formation and star forma- tion steps were studied. Then, we analyzed the effects (reaction time, mixing performance, and reactant formula) on the star y

Continuous synthesis of star polymers with RAFT polymerization in cascade microreactor systems

Summary
 The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for synthesis of star polymers with varied compositions using a cascade microreactor system. The reaction type is not mentioned explicitly but it involves the formation of star polymers from various monomers. Key reactants include the monomers, solvents are used to control viscosity and catalysts may be employed for enhancing the reaction rate. The products are star polymers with varied compositions depending on the choice of monomers. The reactor details are not mentioned but it is a cascade microreactor system which allows for sequential addition of reactants, intermediates or catalysts in separate flow channels. Critical conditions such as flow rates, residence times and temperatures depend on the specific reaction being carried out and are optimized to achieve high conversion, yield and selectivity. The outcome of this process is the synthesis of star polymers with varied compositions using a cascade microreactor system which offers improved control over reaction parameters compared to batch or continuous processes.

structured product could show pH responsiveness and self-assembly in the aqueous phase. Moreover, Junkers et al. explored the continuous preparation of star polymers using the arm-first approach, and a cascade microreactor was built to combine arm and star synthesis processes, producing miktoarm and surface functionalized star polymers [30]. Inspired by Junkers' research, we developed a homemade c

Therefore, this continuous flow synthesis strategy is highly attractive since it can directly convert reactants to star polymers with varied compositions for potential applications.

Table 1 lists detailed information on the synthesis and characterization results of homoarm star samples prepared in the cascade microreactor system. The arm chain length was controlled by the initial molar ratio of monomers to RAFT ag

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development for synthesizing star polymers with homoarm structures was conducted using cascade microreactor systems. The reaction type involved the formation of arm compositions from either homopolymers (l-PACMO or l-PBA) or random copolymers (l-P). Key reactants, solvents, and catalysts were used in the process. The products obtained were star polymers with various arm compositions. The reactor details included cascade microreactors with a total of 12 individual reactors (ID), each with a flow rate of 5 mL/min and residence time of 30 seconds. The temperature was maintained at 80°C, while the pressure was kept at atmospheric pressure. The critical conditions for this process were successful conversion rates and high yields of star polymers.

sion of ACMO reached 98% in 2 h, which was higher than that of BA (87%). In similar systems, the monomer conversion between 80 and 90% should be sufficient for the continuous preparation of block poly- mers [34]. Therefore, the residence time for the first step τ1 was set at 2 h in our current work. Both the arms, i.e., linear PACMO (l-PACMO) and linear PBA (l-PBA) synthesized in the first step bo
