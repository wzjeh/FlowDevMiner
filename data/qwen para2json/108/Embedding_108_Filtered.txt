The experimental setup is schematically illustrated in Figure 1. The experiments were conducted using a tubular microreactor with an internal diameter of 1 mm and a total length of either 2 m or 6 m, coiled into a spiral configuration and fully submerged in a thermostatic water bath (50 × 50 × 30 cm3) with precise temperature control (using JP Se- lecta Thermostat). The reactor was made from aluminum tubing with a wall thickness of 1 mm, ensuring eﬃcient heat transfer.

The influence of reactor length (2 m vs. 6 m) on dye conversion in the flowing micro- reactor was assessed under diﬀerent scenarios: (i) varying the dye–periodate stream flow rate at a fixed H2O2 flow rate (Figure 10a), and (ii) varying the H2O2 flow rate at a fixed dye flow rate (Figure 10b). Further operational details are provided in the caption of Fig- ure 10. Across all tested conditions, no significant diﬀerence in conversion was observed between the 2 m and 6 m reactor lengths, despite their diﬀerent residence times—esti- mated at 3.95 s and 11.84 s, respectively—based on a total flow rate of 398 µL/s (278 µL/s dye + 120 µL/s H2O2) and a tubular geometry of 1 mm internal diameter. When increasing the dye flow rate from 278 to 565 and 1100 µL/s while maintaining the H2O2 flow rate at 120 µL/s, the residence time decreased to 2.92 s and 1.29 s, respectively. Despite this, the dye conversion remained largely unaffected, which suggests that the reaction kinetics of the PI/H2O2 system are extremely rapid. This is consistent with the findings of Chadi et al. [23], who reported nearly instantaneous decolorization of toluidine blue upon periodate activation. Hence, ex- tending the reactor length or residence time offers limited benefit in such fast-reacting sys- tems, as the key reactions are completed within a very short timescale.

namics through microchannels typically ranging in size from 1 µm to 1 mm [28]. Compared to conventional reactors, microreactors provide several advantages, including compact design, high surface-to-volume ratios, and reduced diffusion and conduction distances, leading to improved heat and mass transfer efficiency and laminar flow conditions [27]. These features facilitate efficient radical generation and pollutant degradation in a well- controlled environment, addressing some of the limitations of traditional reactor systems. However, despite their potential, microreactors remain underexplored in the field of AOPs, with limited studies assessing their feasibility for water treatment applications [29]. The present work reports the first application of the PI/H2O2 process in a flowing microreactor, demonstrating its efficiency in micropollutant degradation and mineral- ization. A tubular microreactor (2–6 m in length, 1 mm in diameter) submerged in a temperature-controlled water bath was utilized to facilitate the reaction between PI and H2O2 for persistent-textile dyes degradation. Special focus was given to Basic Yellow 28, an azo dye highly resistant to direct oxidation by either PI or H2O2 alone and non- biodegradable, making its removal from the environment particularly challenging. The removal of synthetic dyes, especially azo compounds, has received considerable attention due to their widespread use, complex structures, and potential toxicity [30,31]. The present work investigates the influence of key parameters, including flow conditions (PI, dye, and H2O2 concentrations), pH, temperature, reactor length, dissolved salts, organic matter, and various water matrices (tap water, treated wastewater, seawater, and river water) on dye conversion. Mineralization tests were conducted under specific conditions to confirm complete degradation of the dye. The obtained results were analyzed in depth, with a particular focus on the effectiveness of this newly adopted approach.

In a subsequent series of runs, the inlet dye–PI flow rate was varied between 278 and 1100 µL/s while maintaining fixed inlet concentrations of PI (1 mM) and dye (25 µM). The results depicted in Figure 8 demonstrated a gradual increase in dye conversion with decreasing dye–PI flow rate. In this operating mode, both dye and PI molar flux were proportionally increased. Except for the case of 278 µL/s at 120 µL/s H2O2, the observed trend was consistent: conversion decreased with increasing dye–PI flow rate. This behavior can be attributed to the previously discussed competition mechanism, where degradation intermediates and by-products compete with dye molecules for reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby limiting the direct oxidation of the dye. In addition, the increase in flow rate reduces the residence time of the reaction mixture, consequently limiting the reaction period available for further degradation, which can negatively impact overall conversion efficiency. However, the lower conversion observed at 278 µL/s (120 µL/s H2O2) compared to 565 µL/s (Figure 8) can be explained by the radical–radical quenching mechanism discussed previously for the unexpected impact of the lower initial dye concentration (12.5 µM). In this case, radical–radical interactions effectively compete with radical-dye reactions, leading to enhanced quenching and a significant reduction in radical availability for dye degradation.

The efficiency of the PI/H2O2 system was investigated under varying inlet solution pH (3–11) and H2O2 flow rates (40, 80, and 120 µL/s). The PI concentration (1 mM) was kept constant, and it was co-fed with the dye solution at 565 µL/s, while the bath temperature was maintained at 25 ◦C. The results, presented in Figure 3, highlight the crucial impact of pH and H2O2 flow rate on the efficiency of this hybrid process. The highest dye conversion was achieved at acidic to near acidic conditions (pH 3 and 5), with maximum degradation observed at 120 µL/s H2O2 flow rate (96.7% and 91.3%, respectively). Notably, at pH 3, conversion improved steadily with increasing H2O2 flow rate: from 38.1% (40 µL/s) to 84.2% (80 µL/s) and 96.7% (120 µL/s), suggesting that acidic conditions favor periodate activation. At neutral conditions (pH 7), the process remained moderately effective, with dye conversion ranging between 31.0% (40 µL/s) and 39.6% (120 µL/s). However, the efficiency dropped significantly at alkaline pH (9 and 11), where conversion barely exceeded 20%, regardless of the H2O2 flow rate. Interestingly,

Experiment runs were first conducted using PI and H2O2 separately to assess their ef- fectiveness in degrading Basic Yellow 28 (BY28) within a flowing conditions under varying oxidant flow rates (40, 80, and 120 µL/s) and inlet pH conditions (3–11), while maintaining a constant dye flow rate of 565 µL/s. Across all tested conditions, dye conversion remained very low (Figure 2), confirming the dye's strong resistance to direct oxidation with molec- ular PI and H2O2. For PI, the highest degradation efficiency (13.96%) was observed at pH 7 and 40 µL/s, with comparable values at pH 9 (12%) and pH 11 (13%). Increasing the flow rate to 80 and 120 µL/s resulted in minor variations, with maximum conversion reaching 13.37% at pH 9 for 80 µL/s and 12.63% at pH 11 for 120 µL/s. Similarly, H2O2 exhibited its highest conversion of 15% at pH 9 and 40 µL/s, though efficiency declined significantly at pH 11 (7.49%). At 80 µL/s, degradation peaked at 13.52% for pH 9 but dropped to 3.31% at pH 11. The highest flow rate of 120 µL/s led to degradation efficiencies ranging between 8.91% and 13.67%, following a similar trend to PI. Overall, these findings highlight the persistent nature of BY28 and confirm that its oxidation by PI or H2O2 alone is unlikely, eliminating direct oxidation as the primary mechanism in the efficient hybrid

The highest dye conversion was achieved at acidic to near acidic conditions (pH 3 and 5), with maximum degradation observed at 120 µL/s H2O2 flow rate (96.7% and 91.3%, respectively). Notably, at pH 3, conversion improved steadily with increasing H2O2 flow rate: from 38.1% (40 µL/s) to 84.2% (80 µL/s) and 96.7% (120 µL/s), suggesting that acidic conditions favor periodate activation. At neutral conditions (pH 7), the process remained moderately eﬀective, with dye conversion ranging between 31.0% (40 µL/s) and 39.6% (120 µL/s). However, the eﬃciency dropped significantly at alkaline pH (9 and 11), where conversion barely exceeded 20%, regardless of the H2O2 flow rate. Interestingly, the ob- served values at pH 9 and 11 (~15–24%) align closely with the arithmetic sum of the indi- vidual PI and H2O2 impacts, indicating a loss of process performance at higher pH. This pH-dependent trend is consistent with previous batch-mode studies. Chadi et al. [23] re- ported similar behavior for Toluidine Blue degradation (H2O2: 10–50 mM), while Kim et al. [17] observed comparable eﬀects for 4-chlorophenol and benzoic acid removal (H2O2: 0.5–10 mM). However, Chadi et al. [17] noted a decline in eﬃciency above 50 mM H2O2, identifying an optimal peroxide dosage for batch experiments. In contrast, no such inhi- bition was observed in our continuous-flow system, likely due to the controlled dilution of H2O2 from the stock solution (50 mM), preventing excessive scavenging eﬀects. To better understand the impact of pH, it is essential to consider the reactive species involved in the PI/H2O2 system and how pH influences their distribution. As discussed in the introduction, previous studies have debated the dominant reactive species in this pro- cess. Chadi et al. [23], the pioneers of this process, reported that •OH radicals play a major role, with only a minor contribution from singlet oxygen (1O2) and IO3• radicals. In con- trast, Kim et al. [17] found that IO3• has no significant role in the process, while 1O2 domi- nates at pH > 6, with •OH radicals being the primary species at lower pH. Similarly, Chen et al. [18] reported that •OH radicals remain dominant across a wide pH range (2–10),
