Flow rate is an important factor which can control the flow pattern and affect the mixing performance in micromixers and microreactors.15,30 The Reynolds number in microstructured devices is usually low due to their small characteristic dimen- sions and low volumetric flow rates, and therefore the flow in micromixers and microreactors is generally within the laminar flow regime.31 Engler et al. demonstrated that the laminar flow in a T-micromixer can be further distinguished among three flow regimes including stratified flow, vortex flow, and engulf- ment flow with the Reynolds number lower than 200.32 Both experimental and simulation results have proven that the increase of flow rate results in a higher mixing quality due to the increased vorticity and disturbance inside the T-junction of the T-micromixer.16,32

Microreactor technology is regarded as a promising process intensification strategy for chemical synthesis due to its unique characteristics, such as well-defined flow properties, high effec- tive surface-to-volume ratio, enhanced heatand mass-transfer rates, improved chemistry, and excellent process safety.1–3

The influence of mixing performance on the nonliving free radical polymerization of acrylamide in capillary microreac- tors was investigated. The mixing process during the polymer- ization in the capillary microreactor was analyzed according to the flow characteristics. A higher flow rate was beneficial for improving the mixing between the initiators and the mono- mers and thus the polymerization rate. A higher temperature was also found to improve the mixing performance and the monomer conversion in the polymerization. However, higher polymerization temperatures led to lower values of Mn and larger values of PDI. The measurement on the viscosity of the reaction mixture with different monomer conversions at vari- ous temperatures was conducted. The viscosity of the reaction mixture significantly increased with the increase of the mono- mer conversion. Nevertheless, the reaction mixture in the capillary microreactor during the polymerization still belonged to the Newtonian fluid because of the low molecular weight of the produced poly(acrylamide). Both diffusion coefficients of the monomers and the polymers were correlated with the monomer conversion, the viscosity of the reaction mixture during the polymerization. With the diffusion coefficients of the monomers and the polymers in hand, the average charac- teristic mixing time in the capillary microreactor during the polymerization was further deduced with considering the mutual effects of the transports of monomers, monomer radi- cals, and polymers. The monomer conversion of 87.0% could be obtained with the capillary length of 15 m at the residence time of 12 min and the reaction temperature of 508C. How- ever, the produced polymers and the residual monomers still could not achieve homogenous mixing in the capillary micro- reactor according to the calculation of the characteristic mix- ing time. The monomer conversion was improved with the increase of the capillary diameter. A heat balance for the polymeriza- tion in the capillary microreactor was analyzed to explain the effect of the capillary diameter on the polymerization perfor- mance. The radial temperature heterogeneity became higher and more hot spots existed inside the capillary microreactor with a larger inner diameter, leading to a higher monomer con- version. Moreover, the flow profile estimation indicated that the deviations from plug flow increased with enlarging the capillary diameter and with the polymerization proceeding according to the calculation of the Bodenstein number. The dispersion effect indicated by the Taylor dispersion coefficient aggravated the inhomogeneity of the reaction condition in capillary microreactors, which was more significant in the microreactor with a larger inner diameter. Thus, poly(acryl- amide) synthesized in the capillary microreactor with a smaller inner diameter led to larger values of Mn and lower values of PDI than those in the capillary microreactor with a

Microreactors are typically described as plug flow reactors. However, the plug flow in a channel is only valid when the radial diffusion is much faster than convective mass transport along the channel length.21,52 The Bodenstein number (Bo) in a dispersion model, provided by Taylor and Aris,21,53,54

controlled by changing the flow rate ratio of different phases or doping nanoparticles into the inner phase for the core sur- face modification. Hornung et al. prepared a series of different polymers with the monomer (acrylamide, acrylate or vinyl acetate) conversion ranging from 80% to 100% at tempera- tures between 70 and 1008C using RAFT polymerization in microreactors.13 The values of PDI were controlled between 1.15 and 1.20 and the average molecular weights were similar to those obtained in the batch reactor. The microreactor tech- nology provided a facile scale-up route for the RAFT polymer- ization, which is difficult for conventional batch processing because of the oxygen-sensitive nature of the RAFT process. Iwasaki et al. achieved a larger scale polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) using a numbering-up strategy with an eight-microchannel reactor system.14 This microreactor sys- tem accomplished a continuous operation for 6 days to pro- duce 4.0 kg of the polymer without any problems, indicating the application potential of microreactors for the industrial production of polymers. As is well known, mixing represents an important phenome- non in many liquid-liquid reaction systems, for example, polymerization, precipitation, crystallization, self-catalysis, enzymatic catalysis, and so on, in which the mixing and the chemical reactions interact.15–17 Optimized mixing perfor- mance improves the contact of reactants and thus greatly influences selectivity, yield and quality of products. In particu- lar, the improvement on the mixing performance may reduce the value of PDI and lead to more target products with desir- able characteristics in many polymerization processes.5,7,18–20

capillary mircoreactors is perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) with a high degree of flexibility, transparency, and strength. PFA is a kind of hydrophobic polymer which is beneficial for minimiz- ing the effect of the boundary layer of the flow in the PFA capillary. All the T-micromixer, the connectors and the capil- lary microreactor were immersed inside the water bath to maintain the set temperature. The aqueous solution of acryl- amide (2.814 mol/L) and the aqueous solution of initiator were delivered into the microreactor system using two syringe pumps (New Era Pump System, NE-1200) at the same flow rates. These two solutions contacted and mixed in a T- micromixer, and then entered into the capillary microreactor inside which the polymerization occurred. The residence time was easily controlled by changing the flow rate of the reaction mixture or the capillary length. To completely quench the polymerization after exiting the capillary microreactor, an aqueous hydroquinone (C6H4(OH)2) solution was fed to a sec- ond T-micromixer and contacted with the reaction stream from the capillary microreactor. The liquid sample was col- lected in a conical flask for further treatment. Poly(acryl- amide) was extracted from the mixed solution by methanol for three times. These three extraction solutions were combined and then dried in vacuum at 258C for 24 h. The solid Poly(- acrylamide) was obtained and further treated for analysis.

Nonliving free radical polymerization of acrylamide was chosen as a model reaction to investigate the effect of mixing performance on the polymerization in capillary microreactors. The polymerization rate was enhanced by increasing the volumetric flow rate and the reaction temperature at a constant residence time. However, higher temperatures led to lower Mn and larger PDI. The reaction mixture viscosity increased significantly during the polymerization. Both diffu- sion and dispersion coefficients were calculated to evaluate the mixing performance in microreactors. The capillary microreactor with a larger inner diameter led to higher monomer conversions, lower Mn and larger PDI compared to the capillary microreactor with a smaller inner diameter, which could be explained through a heat balance analysis for the polymerization and the dispersion effect. Moreover, it was found that the addition of a pre-mixing stage mini- mized the effect of insufficient mixing between the initiators and the monomers on the polymerization.

1.548 mm indicating that deviations from plug flow were enhanced and the dispersion effect could not be ignored. The value of Bo decreased at the outlet of the microreactor com- paring with that at the inlet of the microreactor because of the decrease of the diffusion coefficient. That is, the deviations from plug flow increased gradually with the polymerization proceeding. The Taylor dispersion coefficient can be further expressed as the following

A viscometer (DV2T, Brookfield) was used to measure the viscosity of the reaction mixture to determine the diffusion coefficients of monomers and produced polymers during the polymerization in the capillary microreactor. First, the reac- tion mixture from the capillary microreactor was collected in a tube placed inside an ice-water bath. Solid hydroquinone was put inside the tube for quenching the polymerization. The liq- uid sample was separated from the solid and then its viscosity was measured by the viscometer at the corresponding poly- merization temperature controlled by a heating-cooling circu- lator (DC0506, 258C�1008C, Shanghai FangRui Instrument Co., Ltd. China). The viscosity of the sample was determined by an average value of three measurements and it was consid- ered as the viscosity of the reaction mixture with a certain monomer conversion. The number-average molecular weight and the polydisper- sity index were determined by a gel permeation chromatogra- phy (GPC, Perkin Elmer series 200, American) with a combination of 10 lm PL gel, 300 3 7.5 mm mixed-B and mixed-C columns and equipped with a refractive index (RI) detector. Aqueous sodium nitrate (NaNO3) solution (0.05 mol/L) was used as an eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The molec- ular weight was calibrated according to the standard samples of poly(acrylamide). The measurements were performed at 258C. At least two measurements were performed for each sample, and the average values were taken as the final values of Mn and PDI.

known and has been published by many reports.23–25 In this work, we chose the non-living free radical polymerization of acrylamide to poly(acrylamide) as the probe reaction to inves- tigate the mixing influence on the polymerization in capillary microreactors. Ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) and sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) composed the redox initiator for this polymerization. The mixing characteristics associated with this polymerization in the capillary microreactors were analyzed. Various factors such as volumetric flow rate, resi- dence time, reaction temperature, viscosity, capillary diameter and operational mode, which affect the reaction kinetics or the mixing efficiency and thus the polymerization in the capillary microreactor were investigated systematically. The polymeri- zation performance was evaluated in terms of the monomer conversion (X), the number-average molecular weight of poly- mers and the polydispersity index of molecular weight distri- bution. The variation of reaction mixture viscosity with the conversion and its influences on the diffusion coefficients of monomers and polymers, and on the mixing performance in the capillary microreactor were characterized in details. The characteristic mixing time in the capillary microreactor was deduced with considering the effects of the viscosity variation and the produced polymers during the polymerization. A heat balance calculation for the polymerization in the capillary microreactor was conducted and the dispersion effect was evaluated to elaborate the effect of capillary diameter on the polymerization performance. Furthermore, a premixing stage as an alternative operational mode was added into the micro- reactor system to achieve optimized conditions with low val- ues of PDI for the polymerization.

where u is the average linear velocity of the reaction mixture in the capillary microreactor. In our experiments, the conver- sion of 87.7% could be obtained with the capillary length of 15 m and the inner diameter of 1.016 mm at the residence time of 12 min and the polymerization temperature of 508C. For typical conditions applied, the values of smo and spo were 36.44 min and 84.97 min, respectively. Therefore, the value of to was equal to 84.97 min which was larger than that of tres.

The viscosity variation results in the changes of diffusion coefficients, and thus the evaluation of mixing efficiencies during the polymerization in microreactors becomes tricky. With basically understanding the effects of the temperature, the conversion of monomer and the molecular weight of poly (acrylamide) on the viscosity of the reaction mixture (gR), a power function is developed to predict the viscosity of the reaction mixture during the polymerization in the capillary microreactor

the reaction temperature or the residence time, and they devoted to reducing the PDI value to minimize the product heterogeneity or controlling the microstructures of polymers to improve their performance in some circumstances. It was claimed that the efficient mixing in microreactors was utilized to synthesize polymers to control the product properties such as Mn and PDI in all these studies. However, the mixing performance in the polymerization processes in microreactors was not evaluated systematically even it would be typically affected by a number of factors such as fluid properties, reactor structures, and operational conditions. In fact, the mixing process in the polymerization is much more complicated than that in small-molecule reaction systems due to the heterogeneity of monomers, radicals and polymer chains and the significant variation of fluid properties (e.g., viscosity) during the polymerization. The mixing will play a crucial role in the reaction processes when the characteristic timescale of the chemical reactions involved is of the same magnitude or smaller than the time- scale of the mixing process.21 In fact, the effect of mixing on the reaction processes can be judged by various dimensionless parameters such as the Fourier number (Fo), the Damk€ohler number (Da), the Peclet number (Pe), and others.15,22 In calcu- lations of these parameters, the characteristic mixing time in reactors should be obtained and then compared with other characteristic times (e.g., the characteristic reaction time and the residence time). In polymerization processes, the produc- tion of polymers greatly affects the viscosity and substance diffusivity of the reaction mixture, resulting in the difficulty on accurately estimating the mixing time and characterizing the influence of the mixing performance on the polymerization performance in conventional reactors. With the aid of its fast heat transfer rate, microreactors provide an effective pathway for precise control over the reaction temperature on which the characteristic reaction time usually strongly depends accord- ing to the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the residence time (reaction time) can be easily controlled by changing the flow rate of the reaction mixture or the reactor volume. Poly(acrylamide) is highly water-absorbent and has been widely applied in water treatment and processes like paper making and screen printing as a thickener and suspending agent. The hydrated poly(acrylamide) can be used as poly (acrylamide) gel electrophoresis and used in manufacturing soft contact lenses. More recently, poly(acrylamide) has been used as a subdermal filler for aesthetic facial surgery. More- over, the polymerization mechanism of acrylamide is well

above 0.99, indicating that the acrylamide polymerization can be considered to be a pseudo-first order reaction. That is, the polymerization is first order with respect to acrylamide, which was also reported in previous works using a batch reactor for the acrylamide polymerization.23,34 Furthermore, an apparent polymerization rate constant (kapp) was deter- mined as 0.147 min21 through the slope of the fitting line for the flow rate of 2.62 mL/min. These results indicated that a higher mixing rate should be provided to obtain an intrinsic reaction kinetics of the acrylamide polymerization in the capillary microreactor.

Results and Discussion Mixing in the polymerization process in capillary microreactors

the capillary microreactor during the polymerization can be calculated by the Einstein-Smoluchovski equation with con- sidering the flow pattern as a strictly laminar flow22

With these advantages, polymers with low molecular weight distributions, well controlled molecular weight and structures, can be synthesized using microreactor technology.4–10

According to Eq. 9, the overall characteristic mixing time in the capillary microreactor can be shortened by reducing the inner radius of the capillary. Figure 11 shows the effect of the capillary inner diameter on the acrylamide polymerization at a constant residence time. Interestingly, it was found that the monomer conversion was improved with the increase of capil- lary diameter (Figure 11). As is well known, the free radical polymerization of acrylamide is a highly exothermic reaction. The capillary with a smaller inner diameter had a higher heat- transfer rate than the capillary with a larger inner diameter. Therefore, the heat produced in the polymerization could be removed more quickly from the capillary with a smaller inner diameter (e.g., di 5 0.508 mm). In other words, the tempera- ture gradient possibly existed in the capillary with a larger diameter (e.g., di 5 1.548 mm). The schematic diagram of a heat balance analysis for the poly- merization in capillary microreactors is shown in Figure 12. The heat balance equation can be expressed as the following

According to Eqs. 5 and 8, to increases significantly with the increase of the monomer conversion. To achieve a high mono- mer conversion for the polymerization in the capillary microreac- tor, there would be a challenge that capillaries with rather long lengths should be provided for compromising the overall charac- teristic mixing time with a medium or high throughput. The capillary length required (Lreq) for reaching a homogenous mix- ing condition for polymerization can be deduced as follows49

Due to the laminar flow characteristics within the capillary microreactor, the convection heat transfer could be neglected. Thus, Qexchanged can be calculated as follows
