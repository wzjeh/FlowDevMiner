decreased. However, as the liquid flow rate was further increased, the supplied hydrogen became greatly insufficient such that the aniline concentration and nitrobenzene conversion were quickly decreased. As for high inlet nitrobenzene concentration of 90 mM, the supplied liquid reactant was greatly increased. Hence, except the nitrobenzene conversion could reach about 100%, the increase of the liquid flow rate also caused a quick reduction in the aniline concentration and nitrobenzene conversion. Similarly, for a given gas flow rate, the relationship between Can and ul can be written as,

where ul,max is the maximum liquid flow rate corresponding to 100% nitrobenzene conversion, which could be determined by

From the above analysis on the effect of both the gas and liquid flow rates, it could be found that, to reach a critically high nitrobenzene conversion, excess gaseous reactant should be fed into the reactor. For a given nitrobenzene concentration, there exists a ratio of a minimum gas flow rate to theoretical value for enabling the complete nitrobenzene conversion. Therefore, in this study, the nitrobenzene conversions at various conditions (gas flow rate ranging from 0.01 sccm to 0.35 sccm, liquid flow rate ranging from 5 lL/min to 25 lL/min and inlet concentration ranging from 30 mM to 90 mM) were summarized. These conditions corre- sponded to high conversion rate (P97%) with the smallest required gas flow rate. The minimum gas flow rates for the com- plete nitrobenzene conversion under different inlet nitrobenzene concentrations and liquid flow rates along with the solid lines fit- ted by these data are shown in Fig. 9a. The theoretical values under these conditions are also shown in Fig. 9a, as indicated by the dash lines. It can be seen that increasing the liquid flow rate and inlet nitrobenzene concentration led to an improvement in the mini- mum gas flow rate for the complete nitrobenzene conversion as a result of the increase of the supplied nitrobenzene. Based on

where ul represents the liquid flow rate, Mg = 2 g/mol and qg,

where Can represents the aniline concentration in the effluent, C0 nb is the inlet nitrobenzene concentration, ug stands for the gas flow rate and ug,min is the minimum gas flow rate corresponding to the 100% nitrobenzene conversion. With the above equations, the minimum gas flow rate could be calculated by

3.3.2. Liquid flow rate In this experiment, three inlet nitrobenzene concentrations of 30 mM, 60 mM and 90 mM were selected. The gas flow rate was kept at 0.05 sccm, while the liquid flow rate ranged from 5 lL/ min to 25 lL/min. Fig. 8 shows the variations of the aniline concen- tration and nitrobenzene conversion with the liquid flow rate under different inlet concentrations. Obviously, for a given gas flow rate, the aniline concentration (see Fig. 8a) and nitrobenzene con- version (see Fig. 8b) was firstly kept unchanged and then decreased at low nitrobenzene concentration of 30 mM. They were always quickly decreased with increasing the liquid flow rate at high nitrobenzene concentration of 90 mM, while both of them slightly decreased with increasing the liquid flow rate from 5 lL/min and then quickly decreased as the liquid flow rate was further increased at the moderate nitrobenzene concentration of 60 mM. The reasons leading to these phenomena are described as follows. For a given gas flow rate, the supplied nitrobenzene at low liquid flow rates could be fully utilized to generate aniline at low inlet nitrobenzene concentration of 30 mM. As a result, the aniline con- centrations were quite close to the inlet nitrobenzene concentra- tions and the corresponding nitrobenzene conversions were nearly 100%. As the liquid flow rate increased, the supplied hydro- gen might be insufficient, leading to the decrease of the aniline concentration and nitrobenzene conversion. For the moderate inlet nitrobenzene concentration of 60 mM, at low liquid flow rate of 5 lL/min, the supplied hydrogen could meet the complete reaction requirement so that the aniline concentration was close to the inlet nitrobenzene and the nitrobenzene conversion approached to 100%. As the liquid flow rate increased to 10 lL/min, the supplied hydrogen started to become insufficient but could still meet the most requirement for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. Hence, the aniline concentration and nitrobenzene conversion were slightly

To evaluate the performance of the developed microreactor, the long-term operation for 40 h was carried out. In this measurement, the gas flow rate was kept at 0.05 sccm and the liquid flow rate was maintained at 5 lL/min. The inlet nitrobenzene ranged from 30 mM to 90 mM. The effluents from the outlet were collected every two hour. Fig. 5a shows the variation of the nitrobenzene conversion under different inlet nitrobenzene concentrations. As shown, over the entire operation period, the average aniline con- centrations at the outlet were 29.36 mM, 58.31 mM and 87.93 mM with respect to the inlet nitrobenzene concentration of 30 mM, 60 mM and 90 mM, respectively. The corresponding aver- age nitrobenzene conversions were 97.4%, 97.2% and 97.5%, as shown in Fig. 5b. Such high nitrobenzene conversions under differ- ent inlet nitrobenzene concentrations can be attributed to enhanced mass transfer in the microreactor and excellent catalytic activity of the prepared catalyst layer, both of which facilitated hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to yield good performance. More- over, it can be seen that the nitrobenzene conversion was rather stable, as shown in Fig. 5a. It is indicated that the catalysts have been strongly adhered to the PDA layer to enhance the operation stability. On the other hand, because of enhanced mass transport, the products including the intermediates can be efficiently removed, avoiding the catalyst poison and thereby further improv- ing the stability. In summary, the microreactor with the coated Pd- PDA layer can yield good and stable performance.

The results calculated by these two equations are indicated by the solid line in Fig. 8a. As seen, compared with the experimental results, the maximum liquid flow rate measured from the experi- ment was smaller than these calculated values. This may be due to the mass transport resistance of hydrogen between the phases, which led to early occurrence of the reaction equilibrium and thereby smaller maximum liquid flow rate measured by the experiment.

� Parametric study was performed to optimize the microreactor operation.

the complete conversion of nitrobenzene so that the measured minimum gas flow rate was slightly higher than the predicted value. However, once the supplied became excess, the above prob- lems were weakened. This fact indicates that to guarantee the complete conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline, a slightly higher gas flow rate is required in real operations.

� A high-performance gas-liquid-solid microreactor was developed by electroless deposition.

nitrobenzene hydrogenation were evaluated under various operat- ing conditions by a gas chromatograph. The relationships between the flow rate of reactants (both gaseous and liquid reactants) and the nitrobenzene conversion at various inlet nitrobenzene concen- trations were also explored.

home-made connector was adopted in this experiment, as shown in Fig. 1b. During the operation, the liquid reactant prepared by dissolving nitrobenzene (Analytical Reagent) in ethanol with the ethanol: water = 7:3 in volume and high-purity hydrogen were simultaneously fed into the microreactor using a syringe pump (LSP01-1BH, Longer-Pump, China) and a mass flow controller (FMA-2602A-I, Omega, USA), respectively (see Fig. 1c). A gas- liquid Taylor flow was then formed inside the microreactor. Since the PTFE capillary tube had the inner diameter of 0.6 mm and the outer diameter of 1.0 mm, the corresponding wall thickness was about 200 lm. Such a thin thickness made the PTFE capillary tube semi-transparent, which allows us to capture the images of the flow pattern inside the microreactor by a CMOS camera (GS3-U3-41C6M-C, PointGray, Canada). The effluent was collected

In this experiment, hydrogen and nitrobenzene were simulta- neously fed into the microreactor, forming a typical gas-liquid Tay- lor flow. Both the gas and liquid flow rates will play a significant role in influencing the flow pattern and thereby the performance of the microreactor. For this reason, the effects of both the gas and liquid flow rates were investigated and the results are dis- cussed in the following.

reactant supplied to the microreactor for the catalytic reaction. As a result, more aniline could be produced, resulting in the increase of the aniline concentration. Meanwhile, higher aniline concentration would be achieved with increasing the inlet nitrobenzene concentration under the same gas and liquid flow rates. This is because more nitrobenzene was supplied and larger nitrobenzene concentration created a larger concentration gradi- ent from the bulk to the active surface, enhancing the mass trans- port and thereby producing more aniline. As the gas flow rate was further increased, excess hydrogen was fed into the microreactor to ensure the all supplied nitrobenzene to be involved into the cat- alytic reaction. In this case, the aniline concentration approached to the inlet nitrobenzene concentration. Further increasing the gas flow rate would not change the aniline concentration due to the limited supply of nitrobenzene. Corresponding to the varia- tions of the aniline concentration, the nitrobenzene conversion was also firstly increased at low gas flow rate and then maintained at 97%, (see Fig. 6b). From the above results, it can be found that for a given liquid flow rate, with the increase of the gas flow rate, the catalytic reac- tion experienced two stages: insufficient and excess supply of hydrogen. The change point represented the minimum hydrogen consumption rate, assuming the complete utilization of hydrogen with a 100% conversion of nitrobenzene. Because the complete conversion of one mole nitrobenzene produces one mole aniline

these results, the excess ratio could then be calculated and the results are shown in Fig. 9b. As seen, the excess ratio was gradually decreased with the increase of the liquid flow rate. It is easy to understand that increasing the liquid flow rate resulted in the increase of the supplied nitrobenzene so that more gaseous reac- tant supply of hydrogen is needed. The increased gas flow rate would enhance the mass transport between the phases for both reactants and products, enhancing the utilization of gaseous reac- tant and thereby decreasing the excess ratio. In addition, the excess ratio in the case of low inlet nitrobenzene concentration was larger than that at high concentration. This may be attributed to two rea- sons. On one hand, high inlet nitrobenzene concentration required more gaseous reactant, which accordingly increased the gas flow rate, leading to the enhancement of the mass transfer of hydrogen. On the other hand, high inlet nitrobenzene concentration was ben- eficial for the reaction and formed a relatively high nitrobenzene concentration gradient as compared with low inlet nitrobenzene concentration, which would intensify the mass transport of nitrobenzene. Therefore, the gaseous reactant utilization efficiency under high inlet nitrobenzene concentration was enhanced so that the excess ratio decreased as the inlet nitrobenzene concentration

In this study, a gas-liquid-solid microreactor with the poly- dopamine functionalized surface for coating palladium nanoparti- cles by the electroless deposition was developed for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. Both the surface chemical composition and topog- raphy characterizations indicated that the inner surface of the microreactor was successfully modified with the polydopamine and Pd nanoparticles were well deposited on the modified surface. The long-term performance of the developed microreactor was evaluated. It was shown that not only high nitrobenzene conver- sion but also good stability were achieved in a range of the inlet nitrobenzene concentration from 30 mM to 90 mM. The effects of the gas flow rate and liquid flow rate were also visited. The results showed that for a given liquid flow rate and inlet nitrobenzene concentration, increasing the gas flow rate firstly led to an increase in the aniline concentration and nitrobenzene conversion. Once the supplied hydrogen can meet the complete conversion of nitroben- zene, the aniline concentration became stable and the nitroben- zene conversion was almost 100%. Similarly, for a given gas flow rate and inlet nitrobenzene concentration, when the supplied hydrogen enabled the complete conversion of nitrobenzene, increasing the liquid flow rate showed no effect on the aniline con- centration and the nitrobenzene conversion. However, once the supplied hydrogen cannot meet this requirement, both the aniline concentration and nitrobenzene conversion decreased with increasing the liquid flow rate. It was also found that because of the mass transport resistance of hydrogen between phases, excess hydrogen needed to be supplied as compared to the theoretical values. Excess ratio was thus defined to show this effect. The experimental results revealed that increasing the inlet nitroben- zene concentration and the liquid flow rate could lead to a reduc- tion in the excess ratio as a consequence of enhanced mass transfer.

and hydrogenation of nitrobenzene have been reported for aniline preparation [2–5]. Among these methods, the gas-liquid-solid reactor for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene has been widely used in industrial production because of its high conversion rate and selectivity of aniline as well as mild reaction conditions. In the gas-liquid-solid reactor system, gas reactants usually need to transport through the gas-liquid interfaces and liquid film to the solid catalysts, leading to a quite large mass transfer resistance. Therefore, in order to overcome the mass transfer limitation, high pressure is generally required to increase the amount of dissolved
