The microreaction technology has been widely applied in nitration, as well as other fast and highly exothermic reactions (Kulkarni, 2014; Li et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). As the core equipment of the technology, microreactors exhibit significantly improved mass and heat transfer performance over conventional reactors, thanks to their small characteristic size (typically hundreds of micrometers) and large specific surface area (typically between 1,000 and 10 000 m2/m3, which is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional reactors). The excellent performance guarantees rapid fluid mixing and instant removal of reaction heat (Jensen, 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Yao et al., 2018). In this way, the product selectivity can be significantly elevated (Li et al., 2017). In addition, the smaller liquid hold-up volume in microreactors facilitates intrinsic safety. Recent applications of micro- reactors for toluene nitration are summarized in Table 1 (Fu et al., 2022; Song et al., 2022d; Yang et al., 2022). By analysis, it was found that the process conditions for obtaining simultaneously high toluene conversion and MNT selectivity with reference to DNT were generally either low temperature with high sulfuric acid strength or high temperature with low sulfuric acid strength. Under these operating conditions, the order of isomer distribution of MNT is generally 2-NT>4-NT>3-NT. And, we

The advantages of the microreactor also make it an efficient platform

It is critical for reactor design and process safety to determine the reaction kinetics for toluene nitration. Herein, a continuous-flow platform based on capillary microreactors was established. First, reaction regimes for toluene nitration and its consecutive side reaction (MNT (mononitrotoluene) nitration) were identified. On this basis, the influence of process parameters on conversion of toluene, selectivity of MNT and DNT (dinitrotoluene) and their isomer distribution were meticulously examined, including molar ratio of reactants, sulfuric acid strength, re- action temperature, and residence time. Subsequently, reaction kinetic models coupled with mass transfer were developed, allowing the simultaneous kinetic determination for toluene nitration and MNT nitration. It was found that the logarithm of the observed kinetic constant is proportional to the sulfuric acid strength. The kinetic parameters under 72.7 to 80.1 wt% sulfuric acid strengths were obtained. The outcomes provide a basis for process intensification and optimization of toluene nitration as well as other similar aromatics.

note that the latter case has a higher selectivity for MNT than the former. In addition, Song et al. (Song et al., 2022d) found that with low sulfuric acid strengths, at a conversion of about 75 %, continuing to prolong the residence time resulted in little or no increase in the conversion, albeit at a high temperature of 100 ◦C. This was due to the fact that the water produced by the reaction diluted the sulfuric acid, causing a significant decrease in the nitration capacity of the mixed acid. To solve this problem, they used a second feed of mixed acid to increase the sulfuric

sively utilized in various industries, including dyes, perfumes, pharma- ceuticals, explosives, and pesticides (Kulkarni, 2014; Patel et al., 2021). Mononitrotoluene (MNT) is one of the most representative nitro- aromatic compounds. In industry, MNT is produced by the mononitra- tion of toluene with mixed acid as the nitrating agent. As shown in Scheme 1, the product MNT includes three isomers, which can be further nitrated to dinitrotoluene (DNT, mainly 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT). Furthermore, the reaction is strongly exothermic with a reaction enthalpy of up to 150 kJ/mol (Chen et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2023). To control the product selectivity and process safety, it is usually carried out in multistage continuous stirred tank reactors with an effective heat transfer area typically in the range of 100 to 1000 m2/m3, where the mixed acid is slowly dripped into toluene (D'Angelo et al., 2003). There is an inherent high risk of safety issues due to long reaction time and large reactor volume. In addition, the uneven temperature/concentra- tion distribution resulting from poor heat/mass transfer can lead to the formation of considerable amount of DNT and phenols, which increases the cost and waste disposal during product refinery (Afonso et al., 2018).

acid strength and molar ratio of HNO3 to toluene, allowing the reaction to be continued, but this significantly increased the burden of waste acid disposal. All in all, the existing process development for toluene nitra- tion in microreactors is mainly focused on process parameter optimi- zation and lacks fundamental studies on the heterogeneous reaction regime of toluene nitration in microreactors and the kinetics with coupled mass transfer.
