at a set reaction temperature, a total flow rate of 3.00 mL/min, and a residence time of 60 s (three reaction plates are used). The reaction was quenched with ice water. The upper organic phase was neutralized with saturated sodium bicarbo- nate aqueous solution and then washed with deionized water until it was neutral. The upper oil phase samples were analyzed by HPLC. The residence time was changed by varying the number of reaction plates. The residence time is calculated by Eq. (1):

where 휏 is the residence time (s), VMR is the total liquid holdup of microreactor(mL), Q is the total volume flow rate of feed (mL/min), CT is the conversion of toluene, mT0 is the mass of toluene that did not participate in the reaction which quantita- tively analyzed by HPLC,mT is actual feed mass of toluene which was measured by a balance during feeding(g), YMNT is the yield of MNT, mMNT is the mass of the sample of MNT(g), MT is the average molecular weight of toluene, t is the sampling time(min), and MMNT is the average molecular weight of MNT.

For chemical reactions, an appropriate mole ratio can promote the conversion rate of the reaction, improve the selectivity of the target product, simplify the post-treat- ment process, and reduce the waste [42]. As can be seen from Fig. 6c, e, and f, the yield of MNT increases with the increase in mole ratio. In addition, it can be seen from Fig. 6c, e that the slope of molar ratio is significantly greater than that of tem- perature and residence time, indicating that the molar ratio has a greater impact on the reaction effect than that of reaction temperature and residence time.

of 44.61 °C, residence time of 175.81 s, mass fraction of sulfuric acid of 59.57%, molar ratio of toluene to HNO3 of 1:1.27, and the optimal experimental conditions for the yield of MNT in the microreactor were as follows: reaction temperature of 48.80 °C, residence time of 164.84 s, mass fraction of sulfuric acid of 58.14%, molar ratio of toluene to HNO3 of 1:1.29. Since the optimized operating conditions for toluene conversion and MNT yield were not different from each other, and this work focused on the influence of operating conditions on MNT yield, three repeated experiments were conducted under the optimized operating conditions for MNT yield. The experimental data are shown in Table 5. The predicted toluene conversion was 86.23% and MNT yield was 77.85% under the optimized operating conditions. It can be seen from Table 5 that under the optimized conditions, the average con- version of toluene is 84.99%, and the average yield of MNT is 77.58%. The devia- tion between the actual conversion of toluene and the predicted conversion of tolu- ene is 1.44%, and the deviation between the actual yield of MNT and the predicted yield of MNT is 0.35%. It is further indicated that the predicted values of toluene conversion and MNT yield have a good correlation with the experimental values. Each experimental value within the experimental range can be predicted by mod- eling and analysis, and the appropriate process can be optimized. The production rate of MNT was 56.75 g/h using the optimized process in the laboratory.

Since the influence of operating conditions on toluene conversion is consistent with the influence of operating conditions on MNT yield, and this work focuses on the influence of operating conditions on MNT yield, the 3D response surface is not used to discuss the influence of operating conditions on toluene conversion repeatedly. According to the regression equation of MNT yield, 3D maps of the response surface are drawn. Figure 6 shows the 3D response surface diagram of influencing factors on the yield of MNT. Response surface is a three-dimensional surface diagram composed of response values and design experimental factors, which can directly reflect the influence of each experimental factor on response values. The effects of reaction temperature, residence time, sulfuric acid mass fraction, and molar ratio on the yield of MNT are discussed in detail according to the response surface three-dimensional diagram.

quickly removed, which are particularly suitable for rapid, highly exothermic reactions. Therefore, some researchers have carried out studies on toluene nitration in microreac- tors. In the absence of sulfuric acid as catalyst, Halder et al. [25] conducted toluene nitration experiment in a microreactor with nitric acid as nitration reagent and found that compared with the traditional reactor, microreactors could obtain a higher order of magnitude of the reaction rate, and effectively prevent the temperature out of control by the superior heat transfer performance, but the conversion of toluene was low, only about 40%. Wu [26] carried out toluene nitration in a single-channel glass microreactor, and the conversion rate could reach over 90%, but the amount of nitric acid was large, which was 2–3 times that of the conventional process. Although there are still some problems in using microreactors for toluene nitration, toluene nitration in microreac- tors can enhance mass transfer, improve heat transfer efficiency and effectively improve production safety. RSM is a statistical method to solve multivariable problems by using reasonable experimental design method and obtaining certain data through experiments [27], using multiple quadratic regression equations to fit the functional relationship between factors and response values, and by analyzing the regression equation to find the opti- mal process parameters [28–30]. As mentioned above, researchers have investigated nitration in microreactor with mixed acid, but the research on nitration of toluene in microreactor is not comprehen- sive, and mainly to analyze the influence of factors on the reaction effect, without in- depth study of the strong and weak relationship of factors. In addition, the relationship between the conversion rate of toluene and influencing factors, as well as the relation- ship between the yield of MNT and influencing factors, have not been established. In order to improve the safety of toluene nitration and to study the characteristics of con- tinuous nitration of toluene in the microreactor, MNT was continuously synthesized in microreactor using toluene as raw material, nitric acid as nitration agent, and sulfuric acid as catalyst. The effects of reaction temperature, residence time, mass fraction of H2SO4 in mixed acid, and molar ratio of HNO3 to toluene on the nitration of toluene were investigated by response surface methodology. Variance analysis and significance tests were conducted for toluene conversion model and MNT yield model.

between the actual yield of MNT and the predicted yield of MNT was 0.35%, which further indicated that the correlation between the model predicted value and the experimental value of toluene conversion and MNT yield were good.

In this study, the nitration of toluene was carried out in a continuous-flow microreac- tor, and the influencing factors were analyzed by RSM. The results showed that the mass fraction of H2SO4 in mixed acid had the greatest influence on toluene nitration, followed by the molar ratio of HNO3 to toluene, reaction temperature, and residence time, while the interaction terms had no significant influence on toluene nitration. The significance analysis of the toluene conversion model and the MNT yield model in the microreactor showed that the predicted values of toluene conversion and the MNT yield model had a good correlation with the experimental values. In the experimental range, the toluene conversion model and the MNT yield model could effectively predict the reaction effect. Under the optimal conditions, three repeated experiments of toluene nitration were carried out with a microreactor. The deviation between the actual conversion of toluene and the predicted conversion of toluene was 1.44%, and the deviation

Variance analysis and significance test were conducted for the yield model of MNT, and the results are shown in Table 4. Based on the values of F and p in Table 4, it can be concluded that Τ, τ, ω, MRn are all significant. ω and MRn have high significant effect on the yield of MNT, and the secondary interaction terms are not significant. The p-value of the MNT yield model is less than 0.0001, which indicates that the model is extremely significant, and the Lack-of-Fit F-value of 0.6349 implies that the model is relatively reliable. Figure 5 is the linear fitting diagram of actual yield and predicted yield of MNT by regression equations. It can be

Based on response surface analysis, multiple regression equations for the corre- lation between the yield of MNT ( YMNT ) and reaction temperature (Τ), residence time (τ), H2SO4 mass fraction (ω), and material ratio (MRn) can be obtained:

Residence time is another important parameter affecting reagent conversion and product selectivity. If the residence time is too short, the reagent conversion rate will be low, while if the residence time is too long, some intermediates will be converted into side products, reducing the selectivity of the main product. Under the condition of the same mixed strength, properly extending the residence time is conducive to the full reaction of toluene nitration, but too long residence time

Based on response surface analysis, multiple regression equations between toluene conversion rate ( CT ) and reaction temperature (Τ), residence time (τ), H2SO4 mass fraction (ω), and material ratio (MRn) can be obtained:

Abstract Mononitrotoluene is an important dye intermediate, which is prepared by nitration of toluene and mixed acid. The nitration of toluene with mixed acid is a fast and highly exothermic process. Due to the poor mass and heat transfer performance of batch or continuous kettle reactors, there are safety risks in the nitration of tolu- ene. In this work, the nitration process of toluene with mixed acid was studied in a continuous-flow microreactor. The conversion of toluene and yield of MNT were investigated by varying reaction temperature, residence time, molar ratio of HNO3 to toluene, and mass fraction of H2SO4 in mixed acid. Variance analysis and sig- nificance tests were conducted on the models of toluene conversion and MNT yield. The results showed that the mass fraction of H2SO4 in mixed acid had the great- est influence on toluene conversion and MNT yield, followed by the molar ratio of HNO3 to toluene, reaction temperature and residence time. The experimental values of toluene conversion and MNT yield were in good agreement with the predicted values of the regression equation model. The research results were of great signifi- cance for further understanding the nitration characteristics of toluene in a continu- ous-flow microreactor. This study provides a safe and efficient method for the syn- thesis of dye intermediates.

pumps and continuously reacted in the microreactor. After the chemical reaction of the raw materials in the microreactor, the reaction liquid was directly received. The microreactor adopted in this work was made of silicon carbide. It consists of ten reaction plates in series, each reaction plate with a liquid holding capacity of 1.00 mL and a total liquid holding capacity of 10.00 mL. The reaction plate was composed of the heat transfer layers and the reaction layer. The heat trans- fer layers are at the top and bottom, and the reaction layer is in the middle. The structure of reaction plate is shown in Fig. 2. The reaction layer consists of forty- seven complex structural cells in series. Each cell has internal obstacles, a cylin- drical column, and a V shaped structure. The internal structure of reaction layer is shown in Fig. 3. Before starting the flow process, the microreactor must be cleaned with metha- nol to ensure that it contains no impurities. Subsequently, deionized water was used to clean the whole device. The reaction temperature was set to the predeter- mined value and began to rise. During the preheating process, the experimental device was flushed with deionized water. When the temperature stabilized, tolu- ene and HNO3/H2SO4 mixed acid were introduced to the microreactor by pumps,

As can be seen from Fig. 6b, the yield of MNT increased significantly with the increase in sulfuric acid mass fraction. Figure 6d, f also show the same trend. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, sulfuric acid, as a catalyst in the reaction process, is conducive to the generation of NO2 + ions, and can also absorb the water generated by nitrification reaction. Therefore, increasing the concentration of sulfu- ric acid is beneficial to the reaction. The steepness of the response surface reflects the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable. The higher the slope, the greater the influence of factors. It can be seen from Fig. 6b, d, and f that the mass fraction of H2SO4 has a great impact on the yield of MNT, followed by the molar ratio of HNO3 to toluene, reaction temperature, and residence time. This result is consistent with the previous results of significance analysis of influencing factors. Figure 6f shows the 3D response surface diagram of the influence of mass frac- tion of H2SO4 and molar ratio of HNO3 to toluene on MNT yield. The slope of mass fraction of H2SO4 is greater than that of molar ratio of HNO3 to toluene, indicating that mass fraction of H2SO4 has a greater impact on MNT yield than molar ratio of HNO3 to toluene, and indicating that the mass fraction of H2SO4 has a greater impact on MNT yield than the concentration of nitric acid. Although increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid is beneficial to the prepa- ration of MNT, excessive amount of sulfuric acid will increase the amount of waste acid [40]. Waste acid cannot be discharged directly, but needs to be concentrated and recycled, which increases energy consumption and production cost [41].

will also lead to the generation of dinitrotoluene (DNT), thus reducing the yield of MNT. As can be seen from Fig. 6e, when the molar ratio of nitric acid to tolu- ene was constant, the prolonged residence time promoted the increase in MNT yield.
