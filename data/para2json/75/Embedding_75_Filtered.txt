reactor capillary. Experiments with several designs of liquid distributor have been described earlier by Burns and Ramshaw (1998). These sug- gested that the minimization of internal volume was crucial for ensuring the production of short slug lengths in the reactor flow. A capillary tube of length between 30 cm and 180 cm was used to perform the nitration with internal diameters in the range of 127 mm to 300 mm. This length of tube was chosen to allow several cm.s71 flow velocities with rapid internal circulation while maintaining acceptable pressure drops of the order of a few bar. The reactor tube was coiled and placed on a hot plate that was insulated with layers of polyurethane foam along with thermocouples to verify tube temperature. Due to the rapid heat transfer into the narrow channel coupled with low liquid volumes the reaction was performed effectively isothermally at the tube tem- perature measured by the thermocouples. Slug generation within the PTFE capillary reactor could be checked visually using a stroboscope. Photographs of flow within the capillary were also taken for a nonreacting system using a dyed organic phase. Figure 5 shows the slug flow pattern within a 150 mm bore PTFE capillary

suffice, which may be created by simple manifolding methods. For larger outputs, etched microreactors containing thousands of channels working in parallel will be necessary. Work is underway to develop etched systems to perform these reactions using stacked sheets containing many etched capillary reactors, and this will be reported in future publications.

The use of Equation (6) for the slug flow environment within the microreactor was limited to its theoretical description of the order of the reaction. Since the process described within the model assumes mass transfer only by diffusion, the contributions of convection were not accounted for, and as such Equation (6) has no link to slug geometry or flow velocity. More general empirical models were therefore used to link the calculated reaction rate, given by Equation (8), to the operating conditions of the reactor.

Narrow channel microreactors have been evaluated for the reaction of im- miscible liquid-liquid systems. In order to stimulate rapid interphase mixing and mass transfer, alternating slugs of organic and aqueous phases were generated at a ‘‘T'' piece and flowed down an etched channel in a glass substrate. The detailed flow behavior was recorded photographically. Finally, some benzene and toluene nitration experiments were performed in stainless steel and PTFE capillary tubing in order to explore the industrial potential of microreactors for chemical production.

tube using the distributor shown in Figure 4. Slug lengths of 0.5 mm to 0.6 mm were typically generated using this mechanism.

Improved methods of manufacturing at microscales have opened up new opportunities for the development of compact, efficient, and highly con- trollable reactors. Rapid heat and mass transfer between fluids may now be engineered into reactors by the use of small channels for fluid transport. Short path lengths for thermal and molecular diffusion can provide an ideal environment for rapid exothermic=endothermic reactions while main- taining a laminar flow regime. Scale requirements for efficient mixing by diffusion can be characterized using the following equation (Crank, 1975):

Initial work on the nitration using microreactors was funded by British Nuclear Fuels plc. Further work on the development of microreactors is being conducted as part of the ‘‘Lab-on-a-Chip'' consortium of universities and industry within the U.K., of which Newcastle University is a part.

where D is the diffusivity of the reacting molecules in the fluid, t the residence time, and Fo the Fourier number that determines the level of mixing. For essentially complete mixing over a distance of d, values of Fo should be close to or greater than unity. Much of the development work in the area of microreactors has focused on the use of narrow channel dimensions for rapid mixing of liquids by pure diffusion. Many references for this work can be found in the Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Microreaction Technology (2000). Reaction mechanisms involving multiphase flow have been given less attention, partly due to the greater complexity of their behavior in the presence of a fluid interface. Various methods of contacting multiphase flows in a microenvironment have been proposed. One method described by Burns et al. (1997) is to use parallel streams of liquid confined in narrow channels to allow efficient transfer by diffusion across the inter- face. Devices based on this concept are described by Harper (1997) and Harston et al. (1999). Another method employed for contacting immis- cible liquids or liquids and gases is to produce a matrix of fine droplets or bubbles from a structured array of tiny orifices. This method has been most successfully developed by IMM in the form of its Micromixer. Examples of this are given by Zech et al. (2000) and Bayer et al. (2000). The previously described methods of multiphase contacting do, however, have certain drawbacks. Parallel fluid flow involving purely diffusive transfer requires channel dimensions of below 100 mm to work effectively for rapid reactions. This can lead to high pressure drop requirements or low channel velocities, reducing throughput capabilities for chemical production. Dispersed systems, such as the IMM Micro- mixer, do allow higher throughput due to the larger pipe diameters, though the small size of the droplets and bubbles can create an additional postreaction separation requirement. A third method of contacting immiscible liquids was sought that would allow greater throughput per channel and easy separation; this has lead to the consideration of slug flow as a means of liquid contacting. Slugs of liquid, when confined within narrow channels, can be used to generate high frequency internal circulation due to the combination of shear within the channel and interfacial phenomena. Internal circulation generated by interfacial shear across a droplet interface has long been known as a method of enhancing mass transfer and is described in a wide range of literature, such as Clift et al. (1978). Typical circulation fre- quencies of 10�100 Hz may be expected in submillimeter slugs traveling velocities of the order of cm per second. This provides a method of rapid transport to and from the interface, increasing the concentration gra- dients and mass transfer performance. Slug lengths are generally longer than the channel width with volumes equivalent to droplets with dia- meters two or three times the channel width. Separation of the phases at

regime. Averaged results for three different reactor temperatures are shown in Figure 6 with flow velocities of 15 cm.s71 in all cases. These show a clear enhancement in nitration rate when the narrower bore tube was used for the reaction. An average rate enhancement of 2.6 times was indicated in this experiment for the 127 mm bore compared with the 254 mm bore. Examination of the influence of velocity on reaction rates was also undertaken using several acid batches with 70% to 85% H2SO4. The averaged nitric acid reaction rates obtained are shown in Figure 7. As expected increased concentrations of H2SO4 yielded faster reaction rates due to increased production of NOþ 2 ions. However, increased velocity also led to faster reaction rates, especially for higher H2SO4 concentra- tions where the reaction should be more mass transfer limited. An exponential relationship between rate constant R and flow velocity v of the form shown in Equation (10) was found to fit the results best. Values of empirical constants RV and b based on the data provided in Figure 7 are listed in Table I.

cm.s71 with slugs of typically 0.5 mm to 0.6 mm length provide much faster circulation times in the region of 0.02 s. A more flexible design was adopted for the nitration process in which narrow-bore capillary tubes were used to provide the reactor channels. The use of capillary tubes allowed easy variation in channel length and diameter. Both PTFE and stainless steel systems were produced using a range of narrow-bore capillary tubes that provided the environment for liquid mixing. Figure 3 shows the experimental facility used for per- forming the reaction work. Organic and aqueous flow was supplied either continuously from HPLC pumps or from syringe drivers. These were connected to feed capillaries of 254 mm bore for stainless steel systems and 300 mm bore for PTFE systems. All capillary tubes used for the system were 1.59 mm outer diameter. The feed capillaries transported the liquids from the pumps to the distributor illustrated in Figure 4. Early distributors were produced in stainless steel and later versions were made in PTFE as shown in Figure 4. The distributor consisted of channels drilled out to the same diameter as the capillary tube so that it could be fully inserted, thereby giving the minimum internal liquid volume. However, a small gap was left when positioning the tubes to allow liquid transfer into the

the end of the reactor channel, with a reasonable density difference, may therefore in many cases be achieved through buoyancy due to relatively large slug volumes compared with emulsified systems. The use of slug flow inside a microreactor for the nitration of ben- zene and toluene forms the basis of the experimental work described here.

Results have shown that slug flow within the capillary reactor can be used to provide an efficient means of mass transfer between two immiscible reacting liquids over time scales measured in seconds. For both benzene and toluene nitration the results have shown that higher flow velocities can be used to enhance reaction rates, at the cost of increased pressure drops, probably due to the increased convective transport within the slugs. The exact numerical role of velocity on general performance of the reactor was less clear, as can be seen through the differences in the empirical models shown in Equations (10) and (11). This may partly be due to differences in the chemical systems used for the nitrations, but ultimately underlines the need for fluidic modeling of mass transfer behavior of slug flow at this scale. A positive effect may also be seen in the reduction of the capillary diameter, which should provide shorter path lengths for molecular diffusion. Clearly some trade-off between performance and pressure drop is required for system optimization, but the results emphasize that short path lengths for diffusion combined with rapid internal circulation lead to improved reaction rates within the capillary reactor. Results from both benzene and toluene nitration have indicated that reaction rates in the range of 0.5 min71 to 20 min71 can typically be

A comparison of the quantity of nitrated product created in the reactor for various reactor lengths was also performed. This was used to confirm that the nitration was taking place mainly within the capillary rather than at some point upstream or downstream. Three reactor lengths of 61 cm, 122 cm, and 183 cm were used for the experiments with three different medium-strength acid batches. A velocity of 7.6 cm.s71 was used in all of the experiments. The results are shown in Figure 8 with the percentage of nitrobenzene, by mass, in the output organic given for the three tubes. The results show a general rise in nitrobenzene concentration as tube length and residence time were increased, confirming that nitra- tion was occurring within the capillary tube. A simple model for the consumption of benzene based on this data was difficult to establish, with no clear order of reaction fitting all of the results.

Initial experimental work concentrated on benzene nitration and used a stainless steel capillary reactor with 127 mm, 178 mm, and 254 mm bores. Various acid strengths and reactor temperatures were used in the nitra- tion work and comparisons were made of the reaction rate and byproduct formation. A syringe driver was used to supply the flow for the experi- ments. A 1 mL glass syringe was used to supply acid to the reactor and a 100 mL plastic syringe was used to supply benzene. This resulted in an acid=organic flow ratio of 10.5 for all experiments. Relatively low concentrations of nitric acid were used for the process to provide a benzene=nitric mole ratio in the region of 0.8 to 1.8. The flow ratio was chosen to provide a reaction regime similar to other benzene nitration studies, such as those described by Alexanderson et al. (1978) and Guenkel et al. (1994). The first experiments performed were aimed at examining the influ- ence of capillary diameter on the performance of the reactor. Two 50 cm long stainless steel tubes with internal diameters of 127 mm and 254 mm were used to perform the reaction. A relatively high concentration of H2SO4 was used in the acid batch to provide a strongly mixing limited

produced from a capillary reactor. A comparison of benzene nitration results with some existing processes is given in Table IV. The reaction rates shown for the benzene nitration in the capillary reactor in Table IV were taken from results showing levels of byproducts similar to industrial processes. Higher reaction rates could be achieved using the capillary reactor at the expense of increased levels of dinitrobenzene and dini- trotoluene. Acid composition has been shown to have a strong influence on reactor performance for both benzene and toluene nitration. In both cases greater concentrations of H2SO4 have lead to faster reaction kinetics, giving more rapid nitration but also higher levels of dinitro compounds in the output. Flow ratio has also been seen in the case of toluene nitration to influence the reaction within the capillary with nitrobenzene and nitrotoluene yields increasing when more acid is used in the reactor. The influence of extreme flow ratios on slug length and mass transfer is as yet unclear, and more work will be required in studying the fluid dynamics of the slug flow in order to optimize flow ratio and che- mical composition for the reactor. Levels of oxidation byproducts such as nitrophenol and dinitro- phenol appear to be significantly less than those reported in other processes when lower reactor temperatures are used. This may be partly due to differences in acid composition and the isothermal nature of the reactor. It may also be due to fundamental differences in the method of contacting the phases. It should be noted that no significant attempt has been made to optimize the capillary reactor chemistry or operation towards achieving lower byproducts, so it may be expected that improved product quality should be achieved from a fully optimized process. Throughout these experiments the total throughput from the capil- lary reactor has been of the order of 1 ml.s71. Scaling of the reactor is clearly essential if it is to be used to produce significant quantities of product. Methods of scaling will depend strongly on the process requirements. For kgs to tonnes per year 1 to 100 capillaries would

More recent work used PTFE for the construction of the capillary reactor. This has several advantages over stainless steel such as high corrosion resistance and ease of cutting and machining. The low surface energy of PTFE was also expected to encourage interface detachment and slug formation, based on previous flow visualization data. Toluene nitration was performed with 150 mm bore tubing using a range of acid strengths, reactor temperatures, and flow ratios. A con- tinuous process was operated using HPLC pumps for several of the experiments, allowing easy manipulation of the flow ratios and longer run times. However, corrosion problems with these pumps limited their lifetime for this process. Initial studies of toluene nitration concentrated on the examination of temperature and flow ratio on reaction rates for an acid mixture similar to that used for benzene nitration. This was composed of 78% H2SO4 and 7% HNO3. Reaction rates were calculated as for the benzene nitration using the consumption of nitric acid to characterize the process. The results showed a significant level of dinitrotoluene formation, compared with the limited dinitrobenzene formation in the benzene process, and this was accounted for in the calculation of nitric acid consumption.
