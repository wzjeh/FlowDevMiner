under batch conditions (Table 1, entry 1). Gratifyingly, under these conditions >99% conversion of 2 was achieved. High conversion was maintained even at half the residence time, also providing higher throughput (entry 2). We were interested in observing whether we could decrease the equivalents of the reagents to make the reaction more efficient. A reduction in equivalents did provide quantitative conversion (entries 3−5). We validated that high conversion values for 2 corresponded to achieving a high yield of 3 by performing an isolation for an experiment (entry 3). The collected fractions were combined, filtered, and then dried to provide 99% isolated yield. On using the theoretical needed equivalents (2 equiv of HCl, 1 equiv of NaNO2, and 1 equiv of 1) based on the reaction mechanism, a drop in conversion to 86% was observed (entry 6), which was slightly higher than observed under batch conditions. The equivalents of reagents which were found to be sufficient to provide 99% conversion of 2 were 2.4 equiv of HCl, 1.2 equiv of NaNO2, and 1.2 equiv of 1 (entry 7), and these were used for further optimization. Subsequently, experiments were performed to identify the best temperature, rotation speed, and residence time (Table 2). Residual starting material was observed when operating at a low temperature (2 °C) (entry 1). An additional batch experiment performed with the same equivalents of the reagents resulted in a 92% conversion of 2. Quantitative conversion was obtained both at 20 and 40 °C in the SDR system (entries 2 and 3). Gratifyingly, on operation at half the residence time, thus doubling the throughput, quantitative conversion was maintained (entry 4). The combined residence time for the two steps could be decreased to 1.3 min without compromising the conversion (entry 5). However, lowering the combined residence time to 0.9 min resulted in a marginal drop in conversion (entry 7). On increasing the rotation speed to 4000 rpm, a very slight decrease in the conversion of 2 was observed (cf. entries 5 and 6 and entries 7 and 8). Although the effect is relatively small, it is in line with theory. When increasing the disc speed, turbulence intensity and micro- mixing are increased, leading to a growth of the volume of the well-mixed region at the expense of the volume of the plug flow regime. The well-mixed region has more back-mixing than the PFR region, resulting in a small decrease in reaction rate.47 We selected the following conditions to validate the system in a robustness experiment: a temperature of 20 °C, a rotation speed of 3000 rpm, and a combined residence time of 1.5 min for the two steps (entry 4). This corresponded to flow rate values of 0.262 mL/min for aniline 1, 3.40 mL/min for aqueous HCl, 6.86 mL/min for aqueous sodium nitrite, and 5.69 mL/min for 2. We assessed the flow regime that would be observed under the conditions explored in this study. Two dimensionless numbers are required to determine the flow regime, the Reynolds number (Re) and the rotor−stator gap ratio (G):

28.5 g/h and a potential throughput of 684 g/day. Considering the 19 mL of total reactor volume, a space-time yield of 1.5 kg L−1 h−1 was achieved. Our main goal was to demonstrate the viability of performing this type of chemistry within an SDR system. We believe that the pulsation from the syringe pumps could be partially responsible for the changes in pressure, as the dosing of reagents fluctuated, leading to small changes in reagent stoichiometry. However, these changes in pressure did not compromise the conversion of 2. Implementing mass flow meters would enable more careful monitoring of the reagent stoichiometry.55 These data could then be used to help gain information regarding the pump performance and pressure buildup. The use of gear pumps or HPLC pumps would also reduce the pulsation effects. Moreover, when scaling up the application to full industrial size, the diameter of the piping and connectors will need to increase as well, further limiting the possibility of particle accumulation. For a continuous manufacturing application, this would thus give confidence that this solid-forming process can run uninterruptedly in flow during the entire length of a production campaign. The resulting space-time yield of 1.5 kg L−1 h−1 in the lab-scale SpinPro R10 can be readily translated linearly to a scaled-up industrial process because of the hydrodynamic and geometric self-similarity that underlies the engineering and design principles of the entire SpinPro platform. Moreover, qualitatively similar yields and selectivities are obtained when the following parameters are kept constant when scaling up: Reynolds number, shear rate ratio between the rotor−stator gap and the disc radius, and heat transfer.45−47 Mixing behavior can be predicted and compared using a flow regime map to ensure similar results at different scales. In a SpinPro R300, for example, this will lead to a production rate of 3 of 8.28 kg/day using a reactor volume of 230 mL. In summary, we describe the development of a diazotization and azo coupling within a dynamic spinning disc system. The reactor system enables the process to be performed in a safer and more controlled manner compared to batch systems. In addition, this approach enables the use of water as the sole solvent for preparing azo dyes. In particular, the system facilitated the handling of in situ solid product within the reactor system due to the high shear forces present. The product was isolated by simple filtration and drying. The system was successfully demonstrated in a long run. In a very recent review by Stephens and co-worker, they highlighted successful step-up of a continuous flow process for azo generation has not been reported.56

handling over more extended periods due to settling in the outlet tube inside the reactor. To address this issue, we aimed to reduce the mean particle size by preventing agglomeration and pressure buildup, thus enabling more stable processing. To avoid blockages, we further modified our setup by introducing check valves at all the pumps and by using a 1/4 in. connector and tubing at the outlet. The monitoring of the pressure readings during operation showed a variable pressure profile. A couple of times during the run, the pressure increased to 2.5 bar, presumably due to partial channel blockages. Gratifyingly, this pressure was released after a certain amount of time, returning the system to its normal level. Pump pulsation can result in a change in the reagent stoichiometry. In contrast to the earlier results, measuring the particle size distribution revealed a single distinct VMD value of ∼38 ± 6 μm (average based on measurements for 12 fractions) over the entire experiment (see SI section 6.4.2). The long run demonstrated that the protocol was stable for 120 min and afforded 55.9 g of 3 (98% isolated yield) after filtration and drying. This value corresponds to a throughput of

Initially, the same stoichiometric conditions (8 equiv of HCl, 4 equiv of NaNO2, and 1 equiv of 2) were investigated in the flow reactor as tested that provided quantitative conversion

Furthermore, continuous flow reactors have larger surface to volume ratios, enabling improved heat management.8 These reactor systems have small volumes, and therefore, less energy is needed for processing.9 Continuous flow systems have been demonstrated to improve control over the reaction conditions (e.g., temperature and pressure).10 Continuous flow tubular microreactors or mesoreactors are the most commonly used systems in chemical laboratories since they are widely commercially available and easy to assemble in a plug-and- play manner.11

worker extended this work with a comprehensive optimization study.31 The authors used Little Things Factory (LTF) microreactors with a residence time of 2.4 min to achieve high conversion values. Subsequently, the protocol was scaled up to a mesoscale reactor (i.d. 1.5 mm), but a decrease in conversions was observed. Low concentrations and N,N- dimethylformamide (DMF) as a cosolvent were necessary to achieve a homogeneous liquid system amenable to the reactor systems. DMF should be avoided due to its potential reproductive toxicity.34 There is regulation from the European Commission restricting the use of DMF for manufacture, which started from December 12, 2023.35 A further limitation was that relatively limited throughput was obtained. Baxendale and co-workers made an interesting advance in handling aryl diazonium salts and solid product formation within a dynamic Coflore agitated tube reactor (ATR).36 In that study, the researchers achieved kilogram-quantity continuous production of triacetic acid lactone solid. Herein we outline our efforts in developing a protocol for a diazotization reaction and subsequent azo coupling using an SDR system (Scheme 1b). We selected the diazotization of 2,4-dimethylaniline (1) followed by an azo coupling with 2- naphthol (2) to form the dye Sudan II (3) as a model system (Scheme 2). The main focus was to achieve high conversion values while facilitating the processing of solid product formation. In addition, we were interested in using water as the sole reaction solvent due to its excellent environmental credentials.37−39 The use of water as the only solvent could

mixed within a T-piece to generate a droplet flow regime prior to entering the SDR system. Syringe pumps introduced these two liquid feeds. This flow was then mixed with 0.3 M NaNO2 in the first reactor segment. The first and second reactor segments were used for the diazotization reaction to form the diazonium salt intermediate. In the solid state, diazonium salts are sensitive to friction and shock; therefore, the system was configured so that the diazonium salt remained dissolved in solution and was consumed in situ. 2 was then introduced in the third reactor segment for the azo coupling, so the entire telescoped synthesis could be performed in a single reactor. The reported residence time (tres) for each step was calculated based on the combined flow rates contributing to that section of the reactor (see also SI section 6.2). The feed for 2 was a turbid solution, showing that we were at the solubility limit. We selected this concentration to maximize the productivity per unit time and per volume of reactor. The effluent then left the reactor through a short length of tubing, which was kept moving through the use of two vibration motors (see Figure S5).48

combination of the exothermic neutralization of HCl and NaOH (between −56 and −58 kJ/mol based on literature references)52−54 and the endothermic azo coupling (35.6 kJ/ mol). Subsequently, we were interested in demonstrating the robustness of our optimized conditions over a longer operation time in a scale-out experiment. Efforts were initially made with the same setup used during the optimization campaign. This setup included the use of a 1/8 in. connector and tubing at the outlet. The initial attempts to operate the system for a prolonged operation time resulted in a gradual pressure buildup caused by the accumulation of solid within the system. This buildup led us to stop the experiment after 37 min. To gain further insight into the solid buildup, we evaluated the particle size distribution over the run time of the solids within the collected fractions using laser diffraction of the solids within. For fractions 1 to 2, a volume mean diameter (VMD) of ∼16 μm was measured, whereas later in the operation, particularly for fraction 4, the collected product was observed to have two distinct VMD values of ∼22 and ∼100 μm (Figure 3). The larger of these particles led to complications in

passive mixing is the usage or generation of solids during the reaction. Clogging or reactor fouling is challenging to handle in these systems when attempting to run smooth and continuous operation.15,16 Moreover, solid accumulation can cause pressure buildup within the reactor system, which can have profound safety implications and result in process failure. Efforts to prevent blockages can lead to somewhat cumbersome cleaning and deblocking cycles or result in redevelopment of the chemistry or the avoidance of using a continuous process altogether. The benefit of active mixing devices is that they have the ability to suspend solids and thus prevent fouling from taking place. Continuous flow stirred tank reactors (CTSRs) provide active mixing through agitators capable of suspending solids.17−19 Oscillatory flow reactors use time-pulsing flow due to a periodic change of pumping energy, resulting in active mixing.20,21 Agitated reactors comprise a reaction block which is mounted on a laterally shaking motor.22 Another approach for handling solids is to use rotor−stator technology.23 The high rotation speeds of the rotor and the small gap between the rotor and the reactor housing result in very high shear forces. A Taylor vortex flow (TVF) reactor system comprises a static cylinder shell which contains a rotating cylinder, whereby the shear is generated in the annular volume.24,25 Stator−rotor spinning disc reactor (SDR) technology uses the very high shear forces generated by the rotation of the discs.26 The motion within these active mixing systems counteracts the solid deposition and prevents blocking of the flow channels.

The mixing within a flow reactor can be categorized as either passive or active, whereby the mixing relies on diffusion and pumping energy or provision of other external energy to achieve mixing, respectively.12 Examples of passive mixing devices include Yand T-pieces, tubing, multilaminating, and split-and-recombine.13 The management of solids within continuous flow systems is a major challenge.14 The main disadvantage of using continuous flow systems that rely on
