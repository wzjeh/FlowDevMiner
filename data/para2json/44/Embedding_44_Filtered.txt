The reproducibility of the conversion in the microreactors was investigated by operating several reactors at the same flow rate of gas and liquid simultaneously and comparing their performance. Because all reactors drew liquid from the same batch of reactant, the amount and composition of the deactivating poisons in the feed were identical for all reactors. The reactors were packed with the same batch of diluent and catalyst. The construction of the set- up ensured that all reactors operated at the same pressure and temperature. These observations serve to emphasize that varia- tions in performance are due to the reactor packing, not due to variations in reactants or operating conditions. We account for small experimental variations as follows. Each column is connected to two mass flow controllers, one for gas flow and one for liquid flow. We determined that random deviations from set-point of the mass flow controllers were �2% of full scale. The error in the amount of catalyst in each reactor was less than 1%. The error in temperature was �0.3 8C. Using EA = 94 kJ mol�1 from

The set-up is designed to withstand a maximum pressure of 10 MPa and a reactor temperature of up to 500 8C. In Fig. 1 a schematic overview is given. The effluent of each reactor runs into a gas–liquid separator. The gas effluent of these separators are merged and vented through a vessel that is maintained at constant pressure with a bleed inflow from mass- flow controller and a combined outflow through a back-pressure controller, such that equal pressure is guaranteed in all reactors. The liquid effluent is semi-continuously removed using a six-way valve and a sample loop. Samples of this liquid flow are directed to a fraction collector and, subsequently, analyzed off-line. The two top requirements for the gas–liquid separator are high-pressure resistance and a small internal volume. With respect to the latter, it should be noted that each millilitre of dead space corresponds to up to an hour of residence time and, as a consequence, sampling delay. We have designed and built a funnel with level control that fulfils these requirements. At two different levels at the bottom end of the funnel, the phase is detected with an infrared signal and detector. Fig. 2(a) shows a schematic drawing of the gas–liquid separator. The evolution of the collected light in time during filling and emptying of the funnel is shown in Fig. 2(b).

of 5 MPa and temperature of 140 8C. During experiments, samples were taken at selected time intervals. Each sample was preceded by a ‘waste sample' to flush the lines towards the sample vial. At a typical flow rate of the liquid, 4 g h�1, one sample was taken every 15 min. The analysis was performed off-line in a gas chromato- graph (Chrompack CP9001, 50 m HP-1 column, FID detector).

[30], the combined propagation of these experimental errors in the error of the conversion is 3% or less. This error analysis invites comparison to the experimental error reported in Fig. 4. The experimental error was 3%, comparable to the theoretical prediction. In other words, the packing of the reactors (method optimized before [27]) did not introduce any significant variation in performance. The reproducibility reported in Fig. 4 shows the result of our efforts to optimize the loading and operation of these reactors. We discuss this optimization later in detail, but first, we show that at suboptimal conditions, very significant variations in conversion occured. Fig. 5 shows very significant variations from reactor to reactor. For the space velocity in this experiment, the expected initial conversion based on the autoclave kinetics was 0.501 � 0.007. In only one of the three reactors, the initial conversion was comparable to that value; in the other two reactors, the conversion is close to 0.4 and 0.2, respectively.

where F is the mass-flow rate of biphenyl into the reactor and W is the catalyst mass inside the reactor. In the case of irreproducible results, modelling does not make sense and, therefore, both the resulting value and the error are not representative, as mentioned with the data. The autoclave data were taken from ref. [30].

adequate to describe the relation between conversion and space-time in the autoclave experiments. We now compare the conversion in the autoclave with conversion in the continuous reactors. For a space-time of 0.316 gcat h gBPh �1 the conversion in the autoclave was 0.501 � 0.007. The initial conversion in 5 reactors at the same space-time, in Fig. 4, was 0.472 � 0.016. The difference between the two reactor types is 6%.

bed [27] with a compact reaction zone with a reduced area for heat exchange, such that hot spots can be generated. A hypothetical adiabatic reactor would have a conversion level of 60.5%, or kobs = 2.58 gBPh h�1 gcat �1, for the conditions presented here, to be compared with the isothermal conversion of 50.1% (k = 2.2 gBPh h�1 gcat �1). The rates reported in Fig. 6 are within a range confined by the adiabatic case, and a possible explanation for the somewhat higher conversion levels is a slight temperature rise in completely undiluted and/or highly segregated beds.

Experiments spanning a wide range of dilution ratio (from 0 to 20 units diluent volume per unit catalyst volume) were used to explore the effect of high dilution rates on conversion. The results are presented in Fig. 8. Although the undiluted bed shows an average conversion value in agreement with the reference experiments (0.477 versus 0.501), the error in conversion for the undiluted bed (0.047) is higher than that predicted by the error propagation analysis (experimentally 10% versus predicted 3% relative error). A likely explanation for this increased experimental error is that the undiluted bed is very shallow, only 7 mm high, such that thermal exchange with the isothermal surrounding was insufficient to prevent a small temperature rise. The heat exchange in such a small bed is irreproducible: the bed is too short to statistically average out local packing variations. Adding a small amount of diluent, with a volumetric dilution ratio of less than 5, does significantly reduce the experimental error and also does not lower the conversion extensively. In contrast, at dilution ratios higher than 10, the conversion decreases drastically. We observe a linear trend of conversion versus dilution ratio, resulting in a five-fold reduction of conversion at a dilution ratio of 20 (v/v).

where r is the dilution ratio, i.e. the volume of the diluent and catalyst combined divided by the volume of the catalyst. Xdiluted and Xundiluted are the conversion of the diluted bed and of the undiluted bed, respectively. The paper is organized as follows: after discussion of several design aspects of the reactor set-up and the experimental procedures, we report repeated performance tests that we compare with our experiments in a stirred autoclave, for which we can exclude transport phenomena affecting the kinetics. We analyze the reproducibility, or lack thereof, in terms of visually observed features of the flow.

The external mass-transfer limitation was investigated by variation of the catalyst loading while keeping the space-time constant. Because intrinsic kinetics depend only on space-time and should be independent of flow velocity, this is a convenient direct method to check for mass transfer limitations. The results are shown in Fig. 7. We repeated these experiments at other temperatures (not shown in Fig. 7) that show even less dependence of conversion on flow rates. If any, little influence is observed for a liquid velocity higher than 0.35 mm s�1: at higher flow rates the rate constant is within the experimental error.

The set-up consists of 6 parallel continuous reactors. The reactors have an inner diameter of 2.2 mm and a packed-bed length of 475 mm. The heated part of the reactor consists of coincidentally 6 vertically aligned insulated brass blocks with a heating wire helically coiled around the perimeter. Each block is independently maintained at set-point temperature with a master–slave control loop. The inner 3 blocks (no. 3–5 from the top) are isothermal within 0.5 8C, as was verified in each reactor tube. The catalyst-bed length in this isothermal zone is at least 200 mm. Flow rates of gas (pure hydrogen) are between 5 and 50 ml min�1 (STP) and those of liquid are between 0.5 and 5 g h�1.

The results presented in Fig. 4 show that the performance of the catalyst in the autoclave can be reproduced in the fixed-bed microreactor: (i) accurately, with a deviation of 6% from intrinsic kinetic values and (ii) reproducibly, with a deviation of 3% from a

where X is the conversion, dp is the particle diameter, and Pep is the particle Pe´clet number. To ensure this bed length, in related work [27] we found that the catalyst-loading procedure is as crucial here as it is for larger particles [28]. Berger et al. [29] investigated powder-catalyst dilution in a gas– solid system, from which a model was formulated that represented the deviation of the conversion due to the dilution:

The initial conversion level X(0) for a fresh catalyst was determined by fitting values of X(0) and l in the most appropriate deactivation function [30],

explored the effect of diluent size on shaped catalyst performance. Briefly, their finding was that complete wetting could be achieved in fixed-bed reactors (13 mm id) at liquid velocities below 0.1 mm s�1, but only when the diluent was smaller than 200 mm. At larger diluent size, considerable variation in conver- sion occurred at these space velocities. An alternative approach is to avoid diluents altogether. Normally, this leads to significant liquid maldistribution, a problem that Kallinikos and Papayanna- kos circumvented by packing a string of shaped particles in a tight- fitting column, ensuring good wetting by operating in up-flow [22,23]. Within experimental error, this device reproduced the conversion levels of a large-scale reactor. The objective of the current work is to develop a fixed-bed test to evaluate long-term performance of powder catalysts, such that it gives the reliable rates that are – initially, for the fresh catalyst – the same as those obtained in an autoclave over the whole range of conversion. Our interest in such a test comes from the desire to study the reaction rate and its decline over time without any diffusion limitations inside the catalyst. The most pressing question, in our view, is whether proper catalyst wetting and contacting can be achieved in a reactor without recycles. Eventually, the goal is to perform these tests at high-conversion levels, to avoid the extrapolation of differential reactor behaviour to integral reactor behaviour. In previous studies, we investigated various hydrodynamic aspects such as axial dispersion and hold-up in homogeneously packed systems [24,25], and here we explicitly ask ourselves what happens when the particles are not uniform in size and density. We are most interested in the flow pattern at low velocities and we report dedicated visualization experiments, both in a uniform homogeneous bed and in a segregated one. Our most important result is that the diluent needs to be carefully matched to the catalyst powder to obtain a bed without any segregation. A diluent is still desired in powder packed beds, not so much to enhance wetting, but rather toincrease bedlength for plugflow conditions [4]. A common- used criterion for the bed length L to ensure axial dispersion is [26]:

for the liquid and gas phase, respectively. These velocities are the same as those typically applied in the microreactor.

optimization phase, stage 2). In the first stage, ‘‘quick-and-dirty'' analysis that allows different candidates to be ranked suffices. This stage has benefited significantly [5–7] from advances in the robotics and the fabrication techniques [e.g. 8]. In stage-1 testing one can sometimes avoid multiphase operation by choosing a suitable gas-phase-only model reaction. In the second stage – which we are interested in this paper – experiments must yield accurate data of kinetics and deactivation for process design. Here, the developments have been more gradual, and the existing equipment has been optimized rather than replaced. As a result, Mills and Nicole [9] have argued that the second stage is now often the bottleneck in industrial catalyst development. Miniaturized, automated, parallel reactor systems have been used for decades in catalysis and are still being actively developed, both in academia [10–14] and in industry [15–17]. Classically, in the case of gas–liquid–solid systems, kinetic tests are either performed in autoclaves [13,18] with fresh catalysts in powder form or in fixed-bed reactors with diluted shaped catalysts [13]. While the continuous fixed bed systems have the distinct advantage of showing catalyst performance over longer time, Hickman et al. [19] have argued that incomplete wetting and associated external mass transfer limitations can ‘‘completely dominate'' the kinetics under investigation. To overcome this issue,

their suggestion was to operate such a reactor in recycle at high superficial velocities that ensured good wetting. They used full- sized catalyst pellets with or without 70 mm diluent in a 10 mm reactor at typically 5 mm s�1 liquid flow velocities. Motivated by the same need for full wetting, Bej et al. [20,21]
