with conversion reaching 26.37%, 45.86%, and 58.16% for 40, 80, and 120 µL/s, respec- tively. The highest conversions are recorded at 70 °C, where 70.12%, 83.58%, and 88.47% are achieved. However, at 80 °C, conversion stabilizes or slightly decreases, particularly at the highest flow rate, where it reaches 89.83% at 120 µL/s, a value nearly identical to that at 80 µL/s (91.79%), suggesting a plateau eﬀect.

At 60 ◦C, the positive effect of reactor length persists, with conversions of 41.45%, 54.08%, and 58.17% for 2 m, 4 m, and 6 m, respectively. However, as the temperature increases beyond 70 ◦C, the difference between reactor lengths diminishes. At 70 ◦C, all three reactors exhibit high conversion (82.87% for 2 m, 88.54% for 4 m, and 88.47% for 6 m), and at 80 ◦C, the values converge further (88.72%, 92.32%, and 89.83%). This suggests that above a certain threshold, the process reaches near-complete conversion regardless

follows a clear trend, with longer reactors generally providing higher conversion. At 30 °C, increasing the length from 2 m to 4 m improves conversion from 6.76% to 11.40%, but further extending it to 6 m does not significantly enhance performance (11.03%). A similar pattern is observed at 40 °C, where the 6 m reactor shows the highest conversion (16.38%), but the 4 m reactor performs slightly worse than the 2 m one (8.76% vs. 9.54%). At 50 °C, the conversion increases progressively with length, reaching 30.27% for the longest reac- tor. These results suggest that at lower temperatures, a longer reactor can compensate for slower reaction kinetics by increasing residence time.

Both solutions were mixed at the reactor inlet using a T-mixer, ensuring homogeneous mixing before entering the reactor. The reaction temperature was controlled by adjusting the water bath temperature to 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 ◦C, allowing for systematic investigation of thermal effects on the reaction kinetics. The feed solution temperature was 17–18 ◦C before entering the reactor.

of reactor length. Similarly, Gupta and Samanta [31] reported a maximum degradation efficiency of 99% for CIP (ciprofloxacin) at a solution temperature of 70 ◦C. Moreover, Shen et al. [32] demonstrated efficient degradation of difloxacin under conditions of 2 mM PDS and 60 ◦C, achieving a degradation rate of approximately 80–100% within a concentration range of 2–20 mg/L. Overall, the results indicate that reactor length plays a significant role in dye con- version at bath temperatures up to 70 ◦C, as it increases residence time and enhances reaction efficiency. However, beyond 70 ◦C, the effect becomes negligible, likely due to the reaction reaching complete conversion to the effective heat exchange at 80 ◦C. These findings highlight the importance of optimizing reactor dimensions based on operational conditions to maximize process efficiency.

At 60 °C, the positive eﬀect of reactor length persists, with conversions of 41.45%, 54.08%, and 58.17% for 2 m, 4 m, and 6 m, respectively. However, as the temperature increases beyond 70 °C, the diﬀerence between reactor lengths diminishes. At 70 °C, all three reactors exhibit high conversion (82.87% for 2 m, 88.54% for 4 m, and 88.47% for 6 m), and at 80 °C, the values converge further (88.72%, 92.32%, and 89.83%). This suggests that above a certain threshold, the process reaches near-complete conversion regardless of reactor length. Similarly, Gupta and Samanta [31] reported a maximum degradation eﬃciency of 99% for CIP (ciprofloxacin) at a solution temperature of 70 °C. Moreover, Shen et al. [32] demonstrated eﬃcient degradation of difloxacin under conditions of 2 mM PDS and 60 °C achieving a degradation rate of approximately 80–100% within a concen-

40 ◦C. In the temperature range 40–50 ◦C, the conversion continued to improve, reaching 30.27% (0 mM Fe2+) to 85.91% (0.2 mM Fe2+) at 50 ◦C. At high temperatures (60–80 ◦C), the conversion peaked at 70 ◦C for lower Fe2+ concentrations (100% for 0.01 mM and 0.05 mM Fe2+), while higher Fe2+ concentrations (0.1 mM and 0.2 mM) showed a decline in conversion at temperatures above 60 ◦C, dropping to 68.44% for 0.2 mM Fe2+ at 80 ◦C.

To follow the mineralization of the dye along with its removal, TOC analysis was conducted at the outlet stream of the reactor for two bath temperatures (50 ◦C and 70 ◦C) in the absence and presence of Fe2+ (0.05 mM). The KPS and dye inlet flow rates were maintained at 120 µL/s and 278 µL/s, respectively. The results, presented in Table 4 in terms of removal percentages, show that while higher dye conversion was achieved, the TOC removal was significantly lower, indicating that mineralization kinetics occur at a slower rate compared to dye degradation. This trend is logical, as mineralization involves the conversion of dye degradation byproducts into mineral species (e.g., CO2, H2O), which is a more complex and slower process. Compared to the literature works shown in Table 5, our obtained results are in good concordance in terms of pollutant removal as well as the extent of mineralization. Considering the difference in the reaction mode (continuous for our study and batch for literature), the degradation kinetics in the present study (in terms of SO removal and mineralization) are relatively faster compared to those reported in Table 5 (literature). These findings clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our system for the thermal activation of persulfate, even the very short residence time in our microtubular reactor.

cluding their compact design and large surface-to-volume ratios, which result in shorter diffusion and conduction distances, promoting laminar flow and improved mass transfer efficiency [23]. Additionally, microreactors can be constructed from transparent materials, allowing for real-time visualization of reaction processes and the integration of external light sources for photocatalytic AOPs [25]. These features enable efficient radical generation and pollutant degradation in a highly controlled setting, addressing some of the challenges faced by conventional reactor systems. Nevertheless, despite their potential, the use of microreactors in persulfate-based oxidation processes is still in its infancy, with limited research conducted on their applicability for water treatment purposes [25]. The present study aims to investigate the application of a tubular microreactor (2–6 m in length, 1 mm in diameter) submerged in a temperature-controlled water bath for ther- mally and Fe(II)-catalyzed persulfate activation, both separately and in combination (hybrid mode), to evaluate their efficiency in degrading Safranin O (SO). SO is a phenazine dye of the quinone-imine class, widely used in textiles and as a photosensitizer in electronand energy-transfer reactions [26]. It also serves as a sensitizer in visible light photopolymer- ization [27]. Given its known carcinogenic nature, any presence of this dye in wastewater poses significant risks to aquatic life and necessitates effective removal strategies [27]. The study systematically evaluates process performance under various operating conditions, including potassium persulfate (KPS) and dye flow rates, iron solution concentration (flow rate), and solution pH, across a temperature range of 30–80 ◦C. Additionally, the effective- ness of the thermal and thermo-catalytic persulfate activation processes was assessed in different water matrices, including seawater, river water, tap water, and mineral water, to determine their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. The benefits and limitations of these processes were highlighted, providing insights into the effective application of microreactors in advanced water treatment systems.

ing dye flow rate, particularly in the activated persulfate zone (Tbath > 50 ◦C), indicating kinetic and mass transfer limitations. At a lower dye flow rate (Qdye = 278 µL/s), the con- version efficiency increases significantly from 11.03% at 30 ◦C to 89.83% at 80 ◦C. However, as the dye flow rate increases, the removal efficiency declines, especially at higher flow rates. For instance, at Qdye = 1100 µL/s, the removal efficiency remains below 10% for temperatures up to 60 ◦C and only reaches 42.20% at 80 ◦C, significantly lower than the corresponding values for lower Qdye.

concentration is observed in this range, unlike in batch systems. This can be explained by the relatively low impact of competitive reactions, such as Fe(II) + SO4•– → SO42− + Fe(III) (Equation (13)), which consume SO4•– radicals. In this temperature range, the degradation reaction dominates, leading to a continuous increase in conversion with Fe2+ concentration. In the bath temperature range of 50–60 ◦C, thermal activation of KPS becomes more sig- nificant, contributing to SO4•– generation alongside Fe2+ catalysis. The beneficial effect of increasing Fe2+ concentration persists but is limited to concentrations up to 0.1 mM, beyond which a plateau in SO conversion is observed. This plateau is attributed to the increased significance of competitive radical consumption reactions: Fe(II) + SO4•– → SO42− + Fe(III) (Equation (13)) and the self-recombination of SO4•– radicals: SO4•– + SO4•– → S2O82−

observed mass transport limitations in the present work should be thoroughly addressed in future studies to improve the efficacy of the tubular system for efficient activation of persulfate and other oxidants in the presence of various catalysts. Additionally, while the present study provides experimental data demonstrating the performance of the micro plug-flow reactor for degrading Safranin O, future work will focus on modeling the system using material and thermal balances to determine concentration and temperature profiles along the reactor length, thereby enabling optimization of reactor dimensions for fixed inlet flow conditions.

The observed decrease in dye conversion at higher flow rates is primarily attributed to the formation of intermediate degradation products and by-products. These com- pounds compete with the dye molecules for reactive radicals, particularly SO4•–, leading to a scavenging eﬀect that reduces overall oxidation eﬃciency. At Qdye = 565 µL/s, for in- stance, conversion eﬃciency remains below 15% up to 60 °C and only improves at higher temperatures, indicating a shift in reaction dynamics. Furthermore, kinetic constraints arise as the competition between dye molecules and intermediates alters reaction

The observed decrease in dye conversion at higher flow rates is primarily attributed to the formation of intermediate degradation products and by-products. These compounds compete with the dye molecules for reactive radicals, particularly SO4•–, leading to a scavenging effect that reduces overall oxidation efficiency. At Qdye = 565 µL/s, for instance, conversion efficiency remains below 15% up to 60 ◦C and only improves at higher temper- atures, indicating a shift in reaction dynamics. Furthermore, kinetic constraints arise as the competition between dye molecules and intermediates alters reaction dynamics, poten- tially shifting the dominant degradation pathway or requiring higher activation energy for effective removal. Another crucial factor contributing to this trend is the reduced transit time of dye molecules in the reaction medium. As the dye flow rate increases, the exposure time of each dye molecule to activated persulfate and reactive radicals decreases, limiting the extent of oxidation. This effect is particularly evident at Qdye = 1100 µL/s, where the conversion efficiency remains low across most conditions despite higher oxidant availability. Additionally, mass transfer limitations become more pronounced at higher flow rates, as the reduced contact time between dye molecules and reactive species hinders effective oxidation. In fast-flowing systems, diffusion and mixing effects play a critical role, further influencing degradation efficiency. Overall, optimizing the balance between dye flow rate, oxidant concentration, and ac- tivation conditions is essential to achieving maximum removal efficiency while minimizing radical scavenging effects and incomplete degradation. A careful assessment of operating conditions is necessary to mitigate these limiting factors and enhance process performance.
