When the eﬀect of conversion to L-theanine on residence time was examined, an increase in conversion in proportion to the residence times was conrmed. A similar tendency was observed with both the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite-xed microreactor and the glutaminase–TMPS10.6 composite-xed microreactor, indicating that the performance of the current enzymatic microreactor was equivalent to that of the prototype microreactor despite the non-chemical surface modication of the pores (Fig. S4, ESI†). This increased conversion in the new enzyme microreactor was due to both the improved micro- channel length and the optimised pore size of the silica support for reagent-free, stable enzyme immobilisation. Moreover, we could terminate the theanine production completely by rapid cooling to the vicinity of 0 �C, resulting in temporary oﬀ-

The proposed design of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/glass microreactor containing the glutaminase–mesoporous silica (SBA-15) composite particles is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The SBA particles were immobilised over the entire surface of both sides of the slit in the microreactor, that is, the top and bottom of the ow channel, as follows. A glass substrate (width: 52 mm, length: 76 mm, thickness: 1 mm; Matsunami Glass Ind., Ltd, Osaka, Japan) was used as the base material to fabricate the ow channel of the microreactor. To immobilise SBA particles, the glass surface of the ow channel (Fig. 1a; width: 5 mm, length: 250 mm, depth: 0.2 mm), fabricated by etching the glass substrate, was coated with a thin layer of liquid PDMS prepolymer (SILPOT 184; Dow Corning Toray Co.,

boiling point of ethylamine (16.6 �C). Therefore, the entire microreactor system, including the substrate supply (inlet), main unit of reactor, and product collection area (outlet), were chilled to 4 �C during the theanine synthesis. Further, in order to enhance the enzymatic activity, local control of the reaction temperature (4–50 �C) in the enzyme-encapsulated microow channel was attempted (Fig. 1b). In the ow system in this study, rst, a reaction solution containing the 2 substrates (20 mM glutamine–100 mM ethyl- amine, pH 10) was added into the ow channel containing the immobilised enzyme (ow rate of substrate: 10 mL min�1). We examined whether various reaction temperatures (4, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 �C) with total or local heating of the enzymatic reaction eld in the microreactor aﬀected the conversion to L-

glutaminase–SBA23.6 microreactor allowed a marked increase in conversion ratio and precise regulation of L-theanine synthesis during continuous theanine production. Control of enzyme activity was achieved by means of local heating of the reaction eld in the ow channel, so avoiding eﬀects on temperature-sensitive reactants, and by controlling the pH value of the substrate solution during solution supply. Hence, this novel microuidic reactor system using mesoporous silica as a scaﬀold for enzyme-immobilisation enables eﬃcient continuous synthesis of functional compounds, even from reactive substrates with low boiling points and low thermal stability, and eﬀective on-oﬀ regulation of enzymatic activity by means of accurate control of the reaction temperature and the pH in the micro-reaction eld.

The development of microscale reaction technologies, such as microreactors, for use in the elds of enzyme and biological engineering has recently attracted considerable attention because of the many potential industrial applications for these technologies.1,2 The advantage of using a puried, immobilised enzyme-based microreactor for biocatalytic reactions over using macro scale systems with immobilised cells is that the enzyme- immobilised microreactor facilitates the precise control of the reaction temperature to increase the reaction eﬃciency and reduce the reaction time.3–6 The selective and stable but reversible immobilisation of an enzyme on a solid support provides a reusable, continuous reaction system and oﬀers a promising approach for use in industrial production processes.7

Reaction conditions: enzyme content, 50 mg; composition of substrate, 20 mM glutamine–100 mM ethylamine (pH 10); total volume of reaction mixture, 1.1 mL; reaction time, 1 h; reaction temperature, 20 �C. See also Fig. S3 (ESI†) for eﬀect of reaction temperature on conversion to L-theanine in batch reactions by free glutaminase and glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite.

To examine the optimal substrate solution for synthesis of L-the- anine by the encapsulated enzyme, the eﬀect of pH value of the substrate solution containing 20 mM glutamine and 100 mM ethylamineontheconversionsof L-glutaminetoL-theaninebyfree glutaminase and glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite was conrmed in batch experiments (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, theanine production was predominant at pH 10 in the cases of both free glutaminase and glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite. The optimal pH value for simultaneous hydrolysis of glutamine, i.e., conversion of L-glutamine to L-glutamic acid, was pH 8. Interest- ingly, conversions to L-glutamic acid as a by-product by the free glutaminase and the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite at pH 10 were 37.7 and 2.5%, respectively. Therefore, it was found that the selectivity of L-theanine in the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite (94.4%) was markedly higher than that of free glutaminase without SBA (54.9%) under these reaction conditions. This diﬀerence in enzymatic selectivity behaviour with and without mesoporous silica may be attributed to the diﬀerence in accessi- bility of water molecules to the active centre of the enzymes encapsulated in the mesopores; that is, it can be presumed that water molecules, which are required for glutamine hydrolysis, could not diﬀuse extensively into the pores of SBA, because of the high hydrophobicity of SBA-15-type mesoporous silica (hydro- phobicity for pore surface of SBA > that of FSM).35 Thus, we demonstrated the selective conversion to L-theanine by gluta- minase–SBA23.6 composite as far as the theanine synthesis reaction between the glutamine, the ethylamine and the gluta- minase derived from Pseudomonas nitroreducens is concerned.

Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as adhesive and then sprinkled with calcined SBA powder. It was then heated for 3 h at 85 �C. The SBA particles were then immobilised onto the surface by poly- merization of a PDMS prepolymer layer (thickness: 0.1 mm); as a result, the nal depth of the ow channel was about 0.1 mm (inner volume: ca. 130 mL). Likewise, the SBA particles were immobilised on the ow channel (width: 5 mm, length: 250 mm, depth: 0.1 mm) ditched in a PDMS membrane (width: 50 mm, length: 75 mm, thickness: 1 mm) by polymerization of a PDMS prepolymer layer (thickness: 0.1 mm), resulting in a depthless ow channel. The SBA particle-immobilised surfaces of the glass channel and PDMS membrane were air-dried to remove any unattached SBA, aer which the lower ow channel was sealed with the upper PDMS membrane. The ow channel was tted with 2 microtubes for supplying solution. Recombinant glutaminase was encapsulated in the pores of the SBA-15 immobilised in the microreactor by adding 1 mL of 100 mM ethylamine hydrochloride solution (pH 5.5) containing 0.2 mg mL�1 glutaminase into the ow channel at 10 mL min�1

where c0(glutamine) is the initial glutamine concentration (20 mM), c(theanine) is the theanine concentration aer the g-glutamyl transfer reaction. In order to assess the ow system, the glutamine–ethylamine reaction solution was added to the ow channel containing the immobilised enzyme. The substrate solution (20 mM gluta- mine–100 mM ethylamine) was passed through the reactor at 5 or 10 mL min�1, and the theanine synthesis by the immobilised glutaminase was carried out at various reaction temperatures (4, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 �C) and pH of substrate solutions (pH 4 and 10). Recovery of product solution from the outlet of the ow channel commenced aer an initial 300 mL pre-delivery delay of substrate solution using a syringe pump to reach the steady- state ow in the microreactor. In cases where the entire microreactor system, including substrate supply, the main unit of the reactor, and the product collection area, were heated (total heating), the temperature in the system was controlled using an air heat-type incubator (MIR-154; SANYO Electric Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). In cases where the main unit of the reactor within the microreactor system was locally heated (local heat- ing), the temperature in the main reactor was controlled by temperature control units (Stage top incubator, INU-ONICS; Tokai Hit Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan), while both the substrate supply and the product collection area were kept at 4 �C, using the air incubator mentioned above (Fig. S2, ESI†). Temperatures were made to alternate between 4 �C and 30 �C during the continuous microow reaction by powering the temperature control units equipped with the microreactor oﬀ or on, respectively. The pH values were made to alternate between pH 4 and 10 by changing the pH of the delivery solution. Aer the initial 300 mL pre-delivery, the substrate solutions were passed through the microreactor for 20 straight assays without

theanine (Fig. 6a). As is clear from the gure, interestingly, higher conversion ratios were obtained at each temperature, except for 4 �C, when the main unit of the reactor was heated with local temperature control units, compared to use of total heating. At the optimal reaction temperature (30 �C) for the- anine synthesis, the conversion ratio in the case of local heating was approximately 2 times higher than that in the case of total heating. From these results, it can be speculated that the higher activity shown in local heating of the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composites in the microreactor is associated with suppression of the production of gas-phase ethylamine in the substrate supply unit, given the low boiling point of ethylamine (16.6 �C), during the theanine synthesis reaction. From Fig. 6a, it was found that the activities of the immobilised enzymes increased by local heating in the following order: 30 �C > 20 �C > 10 �C > 40 �C > 4 �C > 50 �C. On the other hand, the activity measured when the entire microreactor system, including the substrate supply, main unit of reactor, and product collection area, was heated to 40 �C, was lower than that at 4 �C, and no production of the- anine was obtained at 50 �C. Furthermore, the conversion ratio at 40 �C in the case of local heating was approximately 4 times higher than that in the case of total heating, supporting the above hypothesis that the ethylamine is vaporised at a temperature range of 10–50 �C. To investigate precise regulation of L-theanine synthesis in the continuous microow reaction, in addition to the above advantage of local temperature control in the reaction system, we also examined the inuence of changes of both reaction temperature and pH value of the substrate solution, containing 20 mM glutamine and 100 mM ethylamine, on the conversions of L-glutamine to L-theanine in a glutaminase–SBA23.6 composite-xed microreactor (Fig. 6b). When the enzymatic activity of the immobilised glutaminase at staggered tempera- tures (i.e., 4 and 30 �C) during the continuous theanine synthesis at pH 10 was evaluated with local heating (ow rate of substrate: 5 mL min�1), the glutaminase–SBA23.6 composites contained in the microreactor indicated alternately the gradual increase and decrease of the conversion to L-theanine at 30 and �C, respectively. The maximum conversion ratio in this microreactor (at 30 �C and a ow rate of 5 mL min�1) was approximately 50%, which was higher than that of the prototype enzymatic microreactor with surface-modied TMPS10.6 used in our previous study (maximum conversion ratio: ca. 10%).13
