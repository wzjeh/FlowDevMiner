3.2.1. The reaction order of DCP Experimental conditions: 2,3-DCP solution (0.4 wt.%): 10 ml/ min; NaOH solution (4 wt.%): 3.1 ml/min; phosphate buffer solu- tion (pH = 7.0, 0.5 mol/L): 15 ml/min. The molar ratio of OH� to DCP was 10 and the reaction temperature was 50 �C. The residence time was varied by changing the length of the reaction tube (0.72– 5.54 m).

aqueous solution containing an excess of Ca(OH)2 and offered a ki- netic model of the overall system using the techniques of potenti- ometry and gas chromatography. Ma et al. [14] studied the kinetics of dehydrochlorination of DCP (mainly 1,3-DCP) and the side reac- tion of ECH hydrolysis. The results indicate that both two reactions can be considered as second order reactions. But all the experi- ments are performed in stirred batch reactor in which the poor mixing performance may mislead the kinetic model based on the assumption of an ideal batch reactor especially when the temper- ature is higher. We can find a deviation of the model from the data when the temperature is higher than 50 �C. As a result, more work should be done to describe the process more clearly. Microreactors are attractive for performing kinetics measure- ments for enhanced reagent mixing, precise control over reaction temperature and residence time, minute reagents consumption [15]. Thus, more accurate kinetic parameters can be extrapolated, which would otherwise be difficult using a batch flask. They have been used to characterize kinetics at Diels–Alder reaction [16], synthesis of sodium nitrotetrazolate (NaNT) [17] and fast exother- mic pre-mixing reaction [18]. In this work, a microchemical system, including a micromixer, a micro-tube and a microneutralizer, was designed to study the kinetics of dehydrochlorination of dichloropropanol. The objective of this work is to improve the accuracy of kinetic investigations and establish a model approaching intrinsic kinetics for reaction mechanism understanding and process intensification. The dichlo- ropropanol solution mixed with sodium hydroxide solution in the micromixer and the reaction proceeded in the micro-tube connect- ing directly to the micromixer. The residence time was strictly con- trolled to several seconds with the quenching effect of the microneutralizer. The reaction kinetics of dehydrochlorination of 2, 3-dichloro-1-propanol, including the order of the reaction, the pre-exponential factor and activation energy of the rate constant, were determined in the presence of caustic soda.

Experimental conditions: 1,3-DCP and 2,3-DCP solution (1 wt.% each): 10 ml/min; NaOH solution (0.65 wt.%): 5 ml/min; phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.0, 0.5 mol/L): 5 ml/min. The molar ratio of OH� to DCP was 1.05 and the residence time of 1,3-DCP and 2,3- DCP were 2 s and 10 s, respectively. The micro-tubes for 1,3-DCP and 2,3-DCP were 0.32 m and 1.62 m, respectively.

process from glycerol [6–11]. This two-step process, shown in Fig. 2, directly prepares DCP from glycerol and gets ECH via the same dehydrochlorination or saponification process. The dichloropropanol formed in the commercial route is in the form of a mixture of two isomers: 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol (1,3-DCP, 30%) and 2,3-dichloro-1-propanol (2,3-DCP, 70%). The dehydrochlorination conditions of both isomers cannot be opti- mized at the same time because the reaction rates of the isomers are quite different. According to the literatures [12,13], the reac- tion rate of 1,3-DCP is about 20 times faster than that of 2,3-DCP. Thus, a long residence time is needed to ensure the sufficient conversion of major 2,3-DCP, which results in an increase of side reaction of epichlorohydrin hydrolysis. The improvement in the yield of epichlorohydrin is naturally limited. Therefore, the deter- mination of kinetic parameters is important to optimize the oper- ating conditions, design reactor and improve the process control. Some work has been devoted to the kinetics. Carrà et al. [12] determined the kinetic parameters of 1,3-DCP and 2,3-DCP in an

pling time. By this method, the conversion (measured in percent- age) is determined within a measurement error of 0.5%.

The samples were collected directly from the outlet of the microneutralizer. The samples were diluted and measured by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) with a flame ionization detector under following conditions: the injection temperature, 220 �C; the column temperature, 70–220 �C, 30 �C/min; the detec- tor temperature, 280 �C. The sample volume for all analysis was 2 lL. The dichloropropanol conversion X is calculated by the fol- lowing equations:

In this study, a microchemical system has been successfully ap- plied to investigate the kinetics of dehydrochlorination of dichloro- propanol in caustic soda. The results show that both the dehydrochlorination processes of 2,3-DCP and 1,3-DCP can be strongly intensified due to the enhanced mass transfer rate, and 2,3-DCP with far less reactivity than 1,3-DCP is absolutely crucial for a sufficient conversion. The reaction rate is found to be first or- der with respect to hydroxyl ion concentration and second order to dichloropropanol concentration. The activation energy of the rate constant is 150 (±10) kJ mol�1 and the pre-exponential factor is 1.61 � 1025. Compared with earlier reports on the kinetics of this reaction, this microchemical system provides information much closer to what the intrinsic kinetics determines, showing distinct values for reaction mechanism understanding and process intensi- fication in further work.

where c10 is the initial concentration of DCP and c20 is the initial concentration of OH�; a is equal to c10 /c20. So the plot of f (X) versus t should be a straight line that passes through the origin. Fig. 7 shows the plot of f (X) versus time at different temperatures accord- ing to the data in Fig. 6. When the conversion is close to 100%, a lit- tle change in the conversion would bring a large difference in the Fig. 7. Because of the measure error, we have deleted the corre- sponding results in Fig. 7 when the conversion is close to 100% in Fig. 6. Table 1 shows the correlation coefficient R2 of fitting the experimental data with two different kinetic models in the range 50–80 �C. The good linearity of the curves indicates that the third order kinetic model is feasible to represent the kinetics of 2,3-DCP.

A schematic overview of the microchemical system is shown in

where A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol�1 K�1) and T is the abso- lute temperature. The fitting parameters from this linear plot of cor- relation coefficient R2 = 0.981 indicate that the activation energy Ea is 150 (±10) kJ mol�1 and the pre-exponential factor A is 1.61 � 1025. It seems that the activation energy is a little high for the reaction. As mentioned before, 2,3-DCP is less reactive than 1,3-DCP because of the inductive effect and the space effect. That means the activation energy of 2,3-DCP would be higher than that of 1,3-DCP. The fact is substantiated by the results in the literature [12]. In the literature [14], the activation energy of 1,3-DCP (40– 60 �C) is 123 kJ mol�1. Therefore the results that activation energy of 2,3-DCP is 150 kJ mol�1 in our work seems reasonable. The kinetic parameters of dehydrochlorination of 2,3-DCP are important for optimizing the operating conditions and improving the process control. For an example, we can model the overall pro- cess including the dehydrochlorination (1,3-DCP and 2,3-DCP) and ECH hydrolysis and enhance the process in microreactors to im- prove the yield in the further work.
