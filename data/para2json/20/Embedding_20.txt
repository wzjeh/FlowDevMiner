3.1. Operating Conditions in the Coaxial Capillary Micro- reactor. In the microreactor, it is crucial that experiments be executed in a uniform droplet flow regime. Therefore, flow patterns in the coaxial microreactor were investigated first. The results are shown in Figure 4. Three regimes were identified: dripping flow, slug flow, and a transitional region, when the flow rates of BA monomer and the continuous water phase were in the ranges 5�50 and 50�800 μL/min, respectively. Stable uniform droplet flow could be formed in a wide range of flow rates when the flow rate of BA monomer was in the range 5�50 μL/min. In the following sections, all the experiments were carried out in this dripping flow regime.

3.2. Comparison of Coaxial Capillary Microreactor and a Stirred Container. Polymerization of BA was carried out in the coaxial capillary microreactor and stirred container under identical experimental conditions. Table 1 shows the experimental results. Comparing the polymer properties (PDI and Mn) obtained in the microreactor with those obtained in the stirred container at approximately the same conversion level, it can be seen that the PDI in the microreactor is much lower and the Mn is much larger. As for the reasons responsible for lower PDI in the microreactor, there are two. First, in the microreactor the polymerization units are highly uniform, and product properties will be the same for each individual droplet. In the micoreactor, the BA droplet was dispersed in the continuous phase in a highly uniform manner, while in the stirred container, the droplet size was widely variable, as seen in Figure 6a. Second, the heat transfer efficiency is high enough to avoid heat accumulation in droplets during polymer- ization. The latter assumption will be further justified by the CFD simulation shown below. The reduced average molecular weight in the macroreactor could be explained by an autoacceleration phenomenon. As a highly exothermic and thermally initiated free radial reaction, there exists an autoacceleration phenomenon in the BA polymerization process due to strong coupling between reaction and transport phenomena. Once the heat removal becomes insuﬃcient, reaction temperature increases sharply. As a consequence, this sudden rise in temperature furtheracceleratestheoverallrateofpolymerizationaswellastherate of heat release. In addition, the termination rate is reduced due to a diﬀusion limitation brought about by an increase in viscosity, and hence a gel eﬀect takes place. Both the above factors lead to faster decomposition of initiator and result in polymers with shorter chains (smaller average molecular weight). The reproducibility of polymerization in the microreactor was also investigated by repeating experiments under identical con- ditions. As shown in Figure 5, the experimental results indicate

In recent years, microreactor technology has been thoroughly studied and applied to various chemical reaction processes.4,5

weight distribution. However, since the slugs were in close contact with the channel wall, flowing resistance increases significantly as the polymerization proceeds, potentially resulting in clogging problems. Besides, taking advantage of the precise control over reaction time and heat transfer eﬃciency oﬀered by a micro- reactor, Lorber et al.20,21 proposed a microfluidic-based approach to monitor the kinetics of free radical polymerization. In the past two decades, micro devices with various geometries including shear flowing, cross flowing, hydrodynamic focusing, and coflowing have been developed for laboratory or industrial use.22 A coaxial micro device, as one kind of coflowing micro devices, has shown good convenience and reliability in control- ling flow patterns such as drop flow, slug flow, and colaminar flow.23,24 It has been successfully used to synthesize materials with some specific configurations, including spherical25,26 or rodlike microparticles,27 Janus particles,28 ternary particles,29

The microfluidic technique is regarded to be quite diﬀerent from the conventional technique in emulsion preparation.32 Due to the miniaturized size, the interfacial tension force and viscous shear forces become dominant in the microfluidic device, instead of the inertial force in conventional devices such as stirring vessels,33,34 which makes the droplets produced in the micro- fluidic device well controllable in size and flow. As reported, the size of droplets generated by a coaxial micro device is highly uniform and the CV (coeﬃcient of variation) value could be less than 2%.35 In addition, due to the high degree of control aﬀorded by microfluidics, monodispersed double emulsions36 and multi- ple emulsions37 could easily be formed in microcapillary devices. In the present work, we employed a coaxial capillary micro- reactor to realize a controllable suspension polymerization within monodispersed drop flow. Using this method, several character- istics of the process may potentially be enhanced. First, reaction heat removal can be enhanced by decreasing the heat transfer distance;the key to controlling a highly exothermic reaction. Second, drop flow in the capillary can provide an identical reaction time in each droplet. Finally, because the droplets are eﬀectively separated by an immiscible, continuous inert fluid, the products or intermediates within the droplets have only a small chance of adhering to the reactor, thereby causing clogging. Thus, it may be feasible to prepare polymers with a molecular weight as uniform as possible in a continuous manner. As mentioned above, though several works on free radical polymerization in microreactors have been reported, their focus stressed either controlling polymer particle size or studying polymerization kinetics. Currently, the characteristics of free radical polymerization in uniform flowing droplets have not been specifically investigated. The eﬀect of droplet size on suspension polymerization is still not clear. Here we selected butyl acrylate as a typical monomer, and a controllable and continuous suspen- sion polymerization process for the preparation of poly(butyl acrylate) was realized by using a coaxial capillary microreactor to generate monodispersed droplets with adjustable size. The reaction conversion and product properties produced using this microreactor method were compared with those of a typical stirred tank vessel representative of batch-type reactors. The influence of the phase ratio, 2,2-azobis(isobutyronitrile) concentra- tion, and reaction time in the microreactor were also investigated to examine the key characteristics of free radical polymerization control. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD);capable of provid ing detailed views regarding localized flow patterns, mixing

that the reproducibility in conversion, Mn, and PDI of the product is quite good. In the stirred container, the size of the droplet was widely distributed (Figure 6a), and droplet coalescence posed a serious problem (Figure 6b). Thus, the local reaction conditions of BA polymerization, including temperature, were hardly uniform. In some regions, localized high temperatures may have led to instantaneous polymerization, generating polymers with shorter chain length as well as branched polymers and hence further contributing to a wider molecular weight distribution. 3.3. Temperature Profile in the Coaxial Capillary Micro- reactor. The local reaction temperature in the droplet for a suspension polymerization method is a critical factor influencing the BA polymerization process. CFD simulation can help calculate the temperature profile and its variance as the polymerization proceeds. Considering the uniform drop flow in a coaxial capillary microreaction, a single droplet model was proposed. In our experi- ments, the flow velocity in the capillary is rather slow (on the order of 0.01m/s).Furthermore,becausetheBAdropletisflowingalongwith the continuous phase and there is no conspicuous relative velocity along the axis of the tube length, heat transfer only takes place between the droplet and the specific volume of water that encom- passes it. Based on these facts, as well as for the purpose of simplifying the simulation, hydrodynamics were not considered in the model. The transient state governing equations, including coupled partial differential equations resulting from heat transfer (conduction) and mass transfer (diffusion and chemical reactions), are

Reducing the characteristic size of the reactor to the micrometer or submicrometer scale brings about a series of advantages such as a uniform flowing state, high heat and mass transfer eﬃ- ciencies, andfastmixingwithinmilliseconds.6�8Microreactorshave already successfully been used in many diﬀerent fields including organic synthesis,9 crystallization, and precipitation.10,11 Microreac- tors have also been applied to various polymerization processes including radical polymerization,12 ionic polymerization,13,14 photo- polymerization,15 and copolymerization.16 Thus we can take advantage of the unique characteristics of the microreactor to potentially overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of free radical polymerization.

macroscale reactors such as stirred tank vessels to achieve the same standard of localized temperature control. 3.4. Factors Influencing Polymer Properties in the Micro- reactor. Effect of Phase Ratio. Figure 9 shows that PDI and droplet diameter increased nearly proportionally with the flow ratio. As discussed in section 3.3, droplet diameter significantly influences heat transfer; therefore it could be speculated that the increase in PDI with flow ratio is due to the increase in droplet size. Effect of Reaction Time. The effect of reaction time was investigatedbyadjusting the capillarylength. As showninFigure 10, the PDI increased with reaction time. This trend could be explained by the diffusion controlled termination mechanism. With the reaction time increasing, both the conversion and viscosity within the droplet increase. The rise in viscosity limits the diffusion of macroradicals and slows down the chain termination rate. There- fore, longer reaction times involve larger viscosity disparities and ultimately result in wider molecular weight distributions. Effect of AIBN Concentration. Higher AIBN concentration means higher radical concentration and faster polymerization. As shown in Figure 11, when the concentration of AIBN increased from 0.2 to 0.8%, the average molecular weight showed a considerable decrease. A faster polymerization rate also generates heat faster, so at higher AIBN concentrations, a larger PDI was observed. Depending on the AIBN concentration, polymers with different average molecular weights could be obtained. Effect of Reaction Temperature. Figure 12a shows the reac- tion time vs conversion curves at different oil bath temperatures. Clearly, increasing the reaction temperature could increase the polymerization rate. From Figure 12a , no trend of autoaccelera- tion was detected. Figure 12b shows a comparison of diﬀerent PDIs obtained at approximately the same conversion level yet under diﬀerent reaction temperatures. Higher temperatures involved higher initiation rates and heat generation and resulted in broader molecular weight distributions. These broader molecular weight distributions were also most likely influenced by the enhance- ment of disordered propagation and termination mechanisms observed at high temperatures, at which the eﬀects of MCR will be more significant.49

to remain constant throughout the reaction. In order to minimize water evaporation, a cover was placed over the top of the beaker. After the required reaction time was reached, polymerization was quenched by cooling the reactor within an ice�water bath. 2.3. Analysis. GPC analysis was carried out on a Waters-515 gel permeation chromatograph equipped with a refractive index detector. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity index (PDI, referred to as Mw/Mn, where Mw is the weight-average molecular weight) of synthesized polymers were determined at 40 �C in THF using polystyrene standard samples for calibration. Conversion was measured using the gravimetric method.

control. However, in the microreactor, the temperature could be more precisely controlled and the entire polymerization process could be maintained at near-isothermal conditions. Thus, in the microreactor it is possible to adjust the average molecular weight of the final product by changing the reaction temperature.

A general conclusion from our experimental and numerical results is that the coaxial capillary microreactor exhibits remarkably high eﬃciency in molecular weight control for highly exothermic free radical polymerization processes due to its superior heat transfer ability. At the same time, using this device, polymers of high molecular weight could be synthesized because the poly- merization is realized in monodispersed droplets which do not have direct contact with the channel surface, thereby limiting any unwanted polymer adsorption to the channel wall. This can defi- nitely benefit processes which involve highly adhesive polymers with higher tendencies to adsorb to the reactor surface. Finally, using a coaxial capillary microreactor, polymers were prepared with high reproducibility. Considering all of these advantages, microreactors are also aptly suited for application to studies involving the kinetics of free radical polymerization.

ABSTRACT: In this work, a new controllable and continuous free radical polymerization process was developed and characterized in a coaxial capillary microreactor. In this process, the monomer solution was first dispersed into monodispersed droplets followed by thermal-initiated polymerization in the following capillary immersed in an oil bath. Poly(butyl acrylate) prepared in this microreactor possessed a much higher average molecular weight (Mn) and far lower polydispersity index (PDI) than that produced in a typical stirred vessel. The microreactor method possesses two unique advantages which allow for the optimization of the free radical polymerization process. First, the use of highly monodispersed droplets as polymerization units ensures that the polymerization process occurs uniformly in each individual droplet. Second, the small droplet size, on the order of several hundred micrometers, greatly enhances heat transfer eﬃciency with no heat accumulation within the droplets during polymerization. A simplified numerical simulation was used to show the superiority of the microreactor in eﬀectively removing polymerization heat due to the miniaturization of the droplets to submillimeter scale. Simulation results also demonstrated that, in contrast to polymerization processes occurring in macroreactors, the polymerization conducted in the microreactor proceeded in a nearly isothermal condition. Experimental results in the microreactor showed that the molecular weight distribution was mainly determined by the size of the droplet, while the molecular weight of the polymer could be adjusted by changing the reaction temperature and 2,2-azobis(isobutyronitrile) concentration. This type of microreactor can potentially be applied to research involving the mechanisms of highly exothermic free radical polymerization processes and can also be used as an eﬃcient tool for their controllable preparation.

In their pioneering work, Iwasaki et al.17 successfully demon- strated the advantages of using a microreactor to carry out the free radical polymerization of several monomers. Their results showed that, for a highly exothermic polymerization process such as the polymerization of butyl acrylate, significant improvement of PDI could be achieved in a microreactor compared to those obtained in batch processes. The microreactor was quite eﬀec- tive in controlling the molecular weight distribution for highly exothermic free radical polymerizations. In general, microreactors have proven to be very eﬀective and versatile when applied to processes involving free radical poly- merization reactions. For example, by using a multistage microfluidic device, Li et al.18 successfully conducted the free radical poly- merization of an acrylate and polycondensation of an urethane oligomer sequentially in one device, using exothermic free radical polymerization to trigger the polycondensation. Through this internal trigger approach, the continuous preparation of polymer particles with an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) and narrow particle size distribution could be realized. Moreover, to achieve precise control of the polymer particle properties, Okubo et al.19 polymerized styrene and methyl methacrylate within microemulsion droplets using a K-M mixer and within segmen- ted flow using a union tee microreactor. They demonstrated that internal circulation withinthe slugs contributed to removalof heat generated in the polymerization process and hence facilitated better control of polymer properties such as size and molecular

by inert continuous phase, a mass insulation boundary condition was set at the phase interface between the water solution and BA monomer. Parts a and b of Figure 8 correspond to simulation results for droplet sizes of 360 and 1000 μm, respectively. Here, we chose 360 μm to represent the average size of BA droplets generated in the coaxial microreactor and 1000 μm to represent the character- istic size of a typical BA droplet in the macroscale reactor. To make a reasonable comparison, both simulation cases were established according to similar geometries and with the same phase ratio (Qd/Qc = 1/20). Figure 8 shows the temperature profiles within the BA droplets for the first few seconds of polymerization. Figure 8a shows that no heat accumulates in the BA droplet during the entire polym- erization process, as indicated by the fact that the highest tem- perature observed in the polymerization process was 103 �C, nearly identical to the environmental temperature. For 500 μm droplets, the largest droplet size that we can produce in our coaxial capillary microreactor, the highest temperature during polymerization was 105 �C (simulation data not shown). This phenomenon can be attributed to better heat transfer perfor- mance due to a reduction in heat transfer distance. Free radical polymerization is a highly exothermic process, and the heat removal rate must be faster than or equal to the rate of heat released by polymerization. In the microreactor, the size of the BA droplet is only several hundred micrometers. This small size not only reduces the amount of monomer involved in polymer- ization but also greatly improves heat removal eﬃciency, allowing

surfactants and a stabilizer (SDS, 0.5 wt %; PVA, 0.5 wt %; Na2SO4, 0.3 wt %) was used as the continuous phase. Figure 2 provides a layout of the experimental procedure. Two microsyringe pumps (TS-1B/W0109-1B, Longer, China) were used to pump the two phases into the microreactor. The BA monomer solution was dispersed into uniform droplets by the sheath focusing force of the water phase flowing from the two side channels. To prevent partial polymerization of BA before dispersion, ice bags were placed on the syringe containing BA monomer and the tube between that syringe and the coaxial micro device. A microscope with 20�200� magnification coupled with a high-speed CCD video camera (PL-A742, PixeLINK, Canada) was used to observe the flow pattern and droplet size in the microreactor. After steady drop flow in the capillary was achieved, the droplets were then heated in an oil bath to initiate and carry out the poly- merization process for a set reaction time. A cold water bath was usedtostoppolymerization. Theproduct, collectedat theendofthe capillary, was washed and dried under vacuum to remove monomer and water. Comparative Experiments in Stirred Container. For compar- ison purposes, the polymerization was also carried out in an 80 mL glass beaker (inner diameter, 46.1 mm; thickness of wall, 2 mm), as shown in Figure 3. An electrical heater with a magnetic stirrer was used to heat the water phase and disperse the monomer. In experi- ments, the water phase was introduced first and preheated to 100 �C before the monomer solution was added. The temperature was set
