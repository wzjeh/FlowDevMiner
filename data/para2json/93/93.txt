Dechlorination of p-chlorophenol was investigated in a single-pass, continuous-flow microreactor system made of two parallel palladized iron plates. The plates formed a microscale channel 27 mm wide, 70 mm long, and 0.2 mm high. The bimetallic catalyst was prepared by electroless deposition of Pd on the reactor plate surfaces. Experiments were performed under steady-state conditions at different temperatures between 293 and 333 K and at a variety of flow conditions in the range from 1.5 × 10-9 to 1 × 10-8 m3/s. A two-dimensional mathematical model, containing convection, diffusion, and pseudo-first-order catalytic reaction terms, was developed to analyze the experimental data and to forecast reactor performance. Depending on the prevailing kinetic and convection/diffusion phenomena, the developed model can be reduced to the ideal plug-flow model or can depict reactor performance that is close to or even worse than the performance of an ideal mixed-flow reactor. Under operating conditions typical to this study, the model and the experimental data indicate plug-flow behavior of the microreactor. Analysis of the obtained chemical kinetic rate constants provides an estimate of the activation energy for this reaction (Ea ) 48.43 ( 6.13 kJ/mol), which remains unchanged despite observed deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivation of the catalyst is caused by reversible catalyst passivity, and it is modeled by second-order kinetics. Analysis of the experimental data shows that the observed deactivation influences only the preexponential factor in the Arrhenius law for the investigated reaction.

(as is often the case for bioremediation or use of zerovalent iron alone4-10). The most frequently used catalysts are Pd, Ni, Rh, and Pt. These are supported on Fe, graphite, or highly porous metallic oxides such as Al2O3. The Pd/Fe catalytic system has gained much attention, because it is highly reactive and because it can be implemented in a number of forms, including palladized iron wire,4 impregnated iron particles,5-12 palladized iron plates,13 and alginate-entrapped cata- lyst.6,11 Different forms of Pd/Fe catalyst have success- fully been used to treat a wide range of chlorinated compounds, including chlorophenols,4-6,9,11,12 polychlo- rinated biphenyls,7-10 and chlorinated aliphatic com- pounds.10,12

Chlorophenols, a major group of pollutants used extensively in pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, dyes, and solvents, are causing great environmental concern because of their toxicity and resistance to degradation.1 Widespread contamination of water supplies with chlo- rinated solvents and pesticides has spurred an intense effort to find efficient and cost-effective treatment. In addition to conventional technologies, such as air strip- ping and granular activated carbon treatments, several types of catalytic chemical degradations, biological remediations, and photochemical decompositions of chlorocarbons have been reported.2-6 The metal-enhanced catalytic dechlorination process is one of the most attractive methods for solving the ecological problems related to contamination with chlo- rinated compounds. Catalytic dechlorination has an advantage over other processes because it eliminates chlorinated hydrocarbons instead of just moving them into another phase or medium (as done, for example, in activated carbon adsorption, thermal desorption, and vitrification). In addition to catalytic hydrodechlorination,2,3 bime- tallic catalysis, along with the electrochemical method, provides very efficient dechlorination because of its ability to thoroughly purify a wide range of chlorinated compounds without leaving chlorinated side products

The chlorinated compounds that are adsorbed on the bimetallic surface are reductively dechlorinated through a series of reactions. According to Graham and Jo- vanovic,6 the chemical process involved in the p-chlo- rophenol dechlorination reaction on Pd/Fe catalyst encompasses three sets of chemical reactions, namely, surface reactions (eqs 1-3), solution reactions (eqs 4 and 5), and the actual chlorine removal reaction (eq 6), as listed below and schematically presented in Figure 1

The overall dechlorination reaction process on Pd/Fe catalyst can be represented as

Figure 2. Illustration of catalyst deactivation due to (a) loss of catalyst base, i.e., dissolution of Fe into the liquid solution; (b) iron hydroxide precipitation; and (c) extensive hydrogen gas formation.

These reactions are found to be dependent on several parameters, including the pH, the Pd/Fe interface area, the extent of palladization, the ratio of the Pd/Fe interfacial area to the amount of chlorine to be removed, and the amount of dissolved oxygen.6,11 Furthermore, reactions and phenomena related to catalyst deactivation are also of concern. In previous studies,6,11,13 appreciable deactivation was observed after extended use of catalysts, typically after several hours of continuous reaction. The deactivation process is introduced by any of the following three causes, graphically illustrated in Figure 2: loss of catalyst base (i.e., dissolution of Fe into the liquid solution), iron hydroxide precipitation, and extensive hydrogen gas formation. Formations of an iron hydroxide layer and a H2 gas blanket are reversible processes, and they result in to temporary catalyst passivity. Both processes can be successfully suppressed by an aggressive pH control in a deoxygenated environment, as demonstrated previ- ously.6,11 Microtechnology has uncovered new scientific solu- tions and challenges in a broad range of areas, from electronics, medical technology, and fuel production and processing to biotechnology, the chemical industry, environmental protection, and process safety. Because of the small amounts of chemicals needed and the high rate of heat and mass transfer, microscale systems are especially suited for reactions with highly toxic, flam- mable, and explosive reactants.14,15 In the area of catalytic chemistry, microreactors are an extremely efficient tool for rapid catalyst screening and for com- binatorial chemistry.16 Moreover, the small length scale of microreactors reduces transport limitations, giving nearly gradientless conditions desirable for the deter- mination of reaction kinetics.17,18 In the past few years, several papers have discussed the field of miniaturiza- tion of catalytic reactors.19-21 However, relatively few studies in this area have investigated heterogeneously catalyzed liquid-phase reaction processes in microscale reactors. A few ex-

amples, reviewed by Ja¨hnisch et al.,14 indicate a 10% to severalfold increase of reaction yield when compared to conventional reactor processes. Recently, the first study of an enzymatic reaction in two-phase flow in a microfluidic device was reported by Maruyama et al.,22 where degradation of p-chlorophenol was realized by solubilized laccase. In our study, the use of a microreactor for the degradation of p-chlorophenol on bimetallic Pd/Fe cata- lyst is presented, which has a potential use in on-site pollutant remediation. The goal of the study is to obtain the dechlorination of p-chlorophenol in a continuous- flow microreactor made of two iron plates palladized by electroless deposition of Pd on the reactor plate surfaces. A mathematical model is developed to describe and predict reactor performance at steady-state conditions. Microreactor simulations are compared with ideal plug- flow reactor (PFR) and continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) models for a broad range of operating conditions. Furthermore, the deactivation of catalyst that resulted in unsteady-state operation is described by a dynamic model. Finally, an estimate of the activation energy for this reaction is obtained.

were immersed in 1 M HCl to remove any foreign metals that might have been picked up during mechanical preparation and to remove surface oxide layers. After a thorough rinsing of the plates with deionized water, two iron plates were attached to a polypropylene mounting disk. The electroless plating of Pd was per- formed by immersion in a disk-coating bath with a solution of 1 mM PdCl2 and 0.1 M HCl, and the disk was rotated at 300 rpm unless the dark orange PdCl2 solution turned colorless. The procedure was always performed under exactly the same conditions to ensure the deposition of the same amount of Pd and to achieve the same surface quality on each plate. After the palladization, the iron plates were rinsed with deionized water and kept for later use without drying. Apparatus and Experimental Procedure. The experimental apparatus for steady-state dechlorination is shown in Figure 3. A pair of palladized iron plates attached to polypropylene disks was used in the mi- croreactor, which was housed in a stainless steel casing, 0.152 m in diameter and 0.019 m thick, with an empty reactor volume of 1.2 mL. The space between the plates (maximum depth of 200 ( 1.02 µm) acted as a flow channel. A Pd catalyst loading of 20 mg (10 mg per plate) was used to dechlorinate p-chlorophenol, which was prepared as a 100 ppm (7.8 × 10-7 mol/m3) aqueous solution and sparged with pure N2 to remove dissolved oxygen. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.3 by HCl addition. The reactant solution was pumped through a tightly closed reactor by a positive-displacement pump in downstream configuration at a constant flow rate in the range from 0.09 to 0.63 ((0.002) mL/min. The mean residence time of fluid in the reactor was between 2 and 12 min over the operating range of flow rates used. All tubing was made of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), and nylon was used for all fittings. The reactor was first placed in a vertical position to eliminate the formation of gas pockets, which might cause the presence of air bubbles in the samples. The experiments were con- ducted for 24 h at temperatures in a range between 293 and 333 K, where the temperatures of both the inlet line and the reactor itself were kept constant. Analyses. The amount of deposited Pd catalyst was calculated from the concentrations of the PdCl2 solution, estimated spectrophotometrically at 480 nm, before and after electroless plating. An Amray 3300FE scanning electron microscope was used to produce micrographs of the Pd/Fe catalyst surface. The concentrations of p-chlorophenol and phenol were assayed using HPLC with a 5-µ, LC-8 column (Supelco). Elution was obtained with a mobile phase consisting of 60 vol % acetic acid/methanol solution (1:99 vol %) and 40 vol % acetic acid/deionized water solution (1:99 vol %) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Absorbance detection was at 254 nm, and the p-chlorophenol and phenol concentrations were determined from calibration curves obtained with standard solutions.

For dechlorination in a microreactor with laminar fluid flow, a two-dimensional (2D) model is developed. Both longitudinal and transverse diffusion and convec- tion in the longitudinal direction are considered, with an irreversible, pseudo-first-order reaction at the cata- lyst surfaces on both sides of the flow channel. For an accurate description of the effects of back-mixing at the inlet of the catalytic area (z ) 0), the precatalytic zone is considered, as shown in Figure 4. In this zone, which represents a defined portion of the system (L′ is ap- proximately 0.1L), the boundary conditions without chemical reaction are taken into account. For steady-state conditions in the single-pass mi- croreactor system before catalyst deactivation, the dimensionless partial differential equation is

Dimensionless variables are defined as ψ ) y/B, � ) z/B, and X ) CA/CA0, where y and z are coordinates in the directions of the reactor height and length, respec- tively, and B represents the half-height of the micro- reactor. CA and CA0 are the concentrations of p-chloro- phenol solutions, with 0 denotating the input concentra- tion. The molecular diffusion coefficient for p-chloro-

phenol in water, DAB, is calculated at different temper- atures using the estimation for nonelectrolytes in liquids at low concentrations.23 For a fully developed velocity profile in a microchannel, the maximum velocity, vm, is related to the velocity in the z direction, vz, by vz ) vm(1 - ψ2). For the catalytic reaction taking place on both parallel plates of catalyst, a previously defined kinetics is used6

where the combination of constant k′ with CH*, the concentration of the reactive intermediate H* due to maintenance of constant pH during the process, yields k ) k′CH*, and further grouping with the catalyst weight, wcat, gives an overall rate constant k′′. Normal- ization of this constant with respect to the characteristic dimensions of the catalyst yields k*, where k* ) k′′/WL and the overall reaction rate is

Figure 5. Comparison of the predictions of ideal PFR and CSTR models together with our model simulations for a wide range of theoretical operating conditions, expressed as different Peclet numbers (0.01 e Pe e 10). The calculations at experimental conditions are also presented (b), where the first three points along the x axis represent experiments at room temperature and at different flow rates of p-chlorophenol solution, whereas further points indicate the experiments at increasing temperatures.

For the numerical solution of the model equations, a finite-difference method was used. Regarding a wide range of theoretical operating conditions, varying nodal densities of meshes were applied. To achieve stability of the system at high Peclet number, Pe, the micro- reactor was divided into several parts along the reactor length, where each outlet profile served as the input for the next section. On the contrary, at Pe values below 0.1, where a lower nodal density is sufficiently accurate, the whole microreactor was treated as a unit. Using the implicit approach, matrices up to 105 × 105 were solved using the Mathematica 5.0 computational tool. To describe the deactivation process observed in experimental studies, the activity term a was added to the reaction rate equation, which accounts for the passivation effects, as presented in Figure 2

for the CSTR. Both contain the characteristic dimen- sionless group k*L/vavB as an independent parameter for reactor efficiency. Figure 5 compares the predictions for the ideal PFR and CSTR models with our model simulations for different Peclet numbers (0.01 e Pe e 10) and shows the results obtained in the experiments. Generally, an increase in the flow rate results in an increase in Pe, and consequently, our model for the microreactor approaches that for a PFR. At Pe ) 10, the model gives close-to-ideal PFR performance, and a further increase in Peclet number results in the com- plete overlapping of the model simulations with the PFR curve, so the results are not presented. As the experi- mental Pe values (based on average axial velocity vav, reactor half-height B, and the molecular diffusivity DAB) were between 17.5 and 223.5 for the whole set of experiments, the results of the model simulations completely match those of the PFR. Similar findings were recently reported by Deshmukh et.al.,25 who compared a 2D computational fluid dynamic simulation of a complex structured post microreactor with various reactor models. For a wide range of temperatures and flow rates, nearly PFR behavior was observed in the model simulations of a microstructured reactor used for hydrogen production from ammonia. Only in the case of very low velocities, expressed as Pe values below 1, does the microreactor shift away from PFR behavior, and at very low values of k*L/vavB, it performs even worse than a CSTR (Figure 5). This phenomenon might be explained by pronounced back- mixing present at slower flows, not taken into account in the PFR model. In the case of very slow reaction kinetics, this results in lower conversions as compared to those obtained at higher flow rates, where the back- mixing from longitudinal diffusion is diminished. Figure 6 presents results of a 2D model simulation of the dimensionless concentration profile in the first

The activity of the catalyst can be described by an nth-order rate equation24

where kd is the deactivation rate coefficient. From the dynamic model for plug-flow reactor in eqs 11 and 12 and the experimental data after the station- ary phase, when deactivation started (at time ts), the order of the deactivation process and the deactivation rate coefficient were evaluated.

Using a wide range of theoretical operating condi- tions, a dimensionless concentration was calculated for the plug-flow reactor (PFR) model, the continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model, and our 2D model. The steady-state mass balance of p-chlorophenol dechlo- rination is given by

constant reported for granular Pd/Fe catalyst at the same temperature (k293 K ) 6.52 × 10-2 m3/kgcat‚s).6 Another study of p-chlorophenol dechlorination with powdered Pd/Fe catalyst at 301 K5 revealed a constant of k301 K ) 3.90 × 10-4 m3/kgcat‚s, and the dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and trichloroethene (TCE) with nanoscale Pd/Fe catalyst10 yielded k295 K ) 9.3 × 10-4 m3/kgcat‚s, which is more similar to our results. The discrepancies in reaction rates are most likely a consequence of the different catalyst sizes and structures. This was also suggested by Zhang et al.,12 who reported average rate constants for the degradation of trans-dichloroethene (trans-DCE) varying between k295 K ) 9.3 × 10-5 m3/kgcat‚s for nanoscale Pd/Fe particles and k295 K ) 9.3 × 10-7 m3/kgcat‚s for microscale iron particles. The comparison of reaction rate constants is summarized in Table 1. From Figure 7, it is evident also that an increase in flow rate, and therefore a decrease in contact time, lowers the conversion of p-chlorophenol on Pd/Fe catalyst. Moreover, the effect of temperature on the dechlori- nation kinetics was studied at temperatures between 293 and 333 K. As expected, the rate of dechlorination increased at higher temperature to achieve k333 K / ) 1.21 × 10-6 m/s at 333 K, and the conversions obtained in a single pass at this temperature reached over 90%. However, in most cases, an increase in the relative p-chlorophenol concentration is observed after a few hours of the steady-state process (this time is defined as ts and varied among experiments), indicating a deactivation of the Pd/Fe catalyst. This phenomenon might be a consequence of several factors: pH changes in the reactor; iron hydroxide deposits on the surface of the catalyst; the loss of catalyst base through dissolution of Fe; and even catalyst flaking, which was noticed at higher temperatures. The changes in the catalyst sur- face at the end of the experiment, as compared to freshly prepared Pd/Fe catalyst, are evident in Figure 8. Modeling of the observed deactivation was approached by applying the reaction kinetics with an activity term (eqs 11 and 12) to the dynamic model for a PFR. For the experimental data after the end of the steady-state

part of the microreactor. A symmetric concentration profile is evident along reactor height because the reaction is taking place on the catalyst on both sides of the microchannel. In the precatalytic region (-L′ e z e 0), a slow decrease in reactant concentration is already observed, resulting from the previously discussed back- mixing in the reactor. The use of Pd/Fe catalyst in the microreactor yielded phenol as the only product of p-chlorophenol dechlori- nation. The ambient-temperature experiments were performed at flow rates from 0.09 to 0.63 mL/min, resulting in Reynolds numbers between 0.12 and 0.77, based on the average axial velocity vav, equilibrium length de, fluid density F, and viscosity µ. This is in agreement with the laminar flow condition applied in the development of the mathematical model. As seen in Figure 7, the model accurately predicts the conversion of p-chlorophenol at different flow rates and yields the corresponding overall rate constant k293 K / ) 1.04 × 10-7 m/s. Considering the catalyst dimensions, calcula- tion of the rate constant gives k293 K ) 1.97 × 10-5 m3/ kgcat‚s, which is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the

We can conclude that catalyst deactivation changed the pre- exponential factor, while leaving the activation energy nearly the same. The Ea values found are in the same range as those reported for the hydrodechlorination of p-chlorophenol over Pd/C catalyst2, but twice as high as those obtained for the hydrodechlorination of p- chlorophenol over Pd/ACC catalyst3.

phase of the continuous process (after time ts), the reduction of catalyst activity is described as a second- order process (n ) 2 in eq 12). The evaluated values for the deactivation rate coefficient kd are 0.0409, 0.094, and 0.164 h-1 for processes at 293, 303, and 323 K, respec- tively. Figure 9 shows the experimental data at 293, 303, and 323 K and the applied model after the beginning of the deactivation process. Figure 10 presents the temperature dependence of the experimental overall rate constant, determined during a steady-state phase before catalyst deactivation and after 24 h of continuous processing. Upon application of the Arrhenius law, the calculated activation energy for the steady-state conditions is Ea ) (48.43 ( 6.13) × 103 J/mol, and the preexponential factor is k0 ) 57.14

Dechlorination of p-chlorophenol was achieved on a Pd/Fe catalyst in a single-pass microreactor system. A 2D model, developed for this specific system, accurately predicts the experimental conversions and enables the

calculation of overall reaction rate constants. Compari- son of the model simulations with ideal reactor predic- tions effectively shows PFR behavior at the operating conditions applied in the experiments. The experimental results indicate moderate efficiency of the catalytic reaction in a microreactor system at room temperature. Increased temperatures resulted in higher conversions and overall reaction rate constants, although they are up to 3 orders of magnitude lower than those reported for granular and nanoscale Pd/Fe catalyst. Moreover, the deactivation of the catalyst was observed after a few hours of steady-state continuous processing and was described as a second-order process. Passivation of the catalyst resulted in a lower Arrhenius preexponential factor for the dechlorination process compared to the initial rates. The application of recent advances in microfabrication techniques for catalytic reactors would probably ensure a more stable catalyst and therefore diminish undesirable deactivation.
