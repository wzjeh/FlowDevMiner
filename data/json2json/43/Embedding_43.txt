where [[HNO3] � 14] is a reduced nitric acid concentration and k1 is the pseudo-first order rate constant. Experiments have been conducted at high flow velocity and low temperature ranges where the mass transfer resistance is assumed to be negligible. Experiments were conducted using 120 cm long reactor with inner diameter of 775 mm. Reactants flow rates were 3.0 ml/min of toluene and 1.0 ml/min of 90% (w/w) HNO3. The reaction temperatures were 22, 29 and 35 8C. The conversions of the limiting reactant, nitric acid, at these three temperatures were found to be 7.13, 8.97 and 12.3%, respectively. Correspondingly the conversions based on reduced nitric acid concentration were 20.32, 25.56 and 35.04%.

Figs. 6–9 show the comparison of the conversion and the average reaction rates for the batch reactor and the microreactor at two temperatures of 60 8C and 22 8C. The average reaction rates reported in these figures are based on whole reactor volume and not on the acid phase only. Based on the acid phase volume

our experimental conditions, since had mass transfer affected the reaction rates, the actual conversions would have been much lower than conversions predicted by kinetics. The differences between the experimental and predicted conversions could be due to several assumptions made in developing the rate equation which might not be very accurate. In the batch reactor at 22 8C kinetics might have more influence on the rate than at 60 8C, which made the ratio of the rate in microreactor and batch reactor higher at 60 8C. The rate in the batch reactor at 60 8C might either be fully controlled by mass transfer or kinetics might have some influence on the rate. The enhanced mass transfer rate in a microreactor is due to circulation of small alternating slugs of the two liquids at very high speed inside the reactor as stated by Burns and Ramshaw [8]. These alternate slugs were also observed in our work when a transparent tube was installed at the outlet of the stainless tube reactor.

immersed in the constant temperature bath. All the following data in the microreactor were taken from this reactor of length 120 cm, practically all of which was immersed in the constant temperature bath.

For a comparison of this conversion with the conversion at the higher temperature of 60 8C, the 60 8C data are also included in Fig. 5. Although the data at 60 8C suggest that final conversion was attained at 160 s residence time, data for the 22 8C run show that conversion was still increasing with residence time and if the trend of Fig. 4 continues, the final conversion would probably have been more than that of 60 8C. These data might explain the reason why we were not obtaining our desired increase in the selectivity of p-nitrotoluene with solid acids, particularly with ZSM-5-280 catalyst. The data suggest that most of the conversion was taking place outside the solid acid catalyst bed.

the jacket at a temperature which would give the desired reactor temperature. After the reactor attained the desired temperature, 15 ml of toluene was introduced into the reactor by a syringe through the sampling port. The total volume of the reactants was thus 20 ml. After adding the toluene, the temperature of the reactor was found to rise immediately, however very quickly it came back to the desired reactor temperature due to the cooling by the jacket. The reactor temperature was maintained constant by circulating water from the constant temperature bath through the jacket. The stirrer speed was kept constant at 400 rpm. Although this is a liquid–liquid reaction, during a run the pressure of the reactor was found to increase with time even in a run made at 22 8C. We found some brown fumes to be present in the reactor after the completion of the run. This is possibly due to the formation of some nitrogen dioxide which increased the reactor pressure. Under this gas pressure, samples were collected at different times through the sampling port. The conversion and isomeric distribution were determined in a gas chromatograph as mentioned before.

the rates would be 4 times higher than the rates reported in the figures. The microreactor data were obtained in a 120 cm long 775 mm inner diameter empty microreactor as mentioned before. The values of the ratio of the reaction rates of the two reactors at 60 8C and 22 8C as shown in Figs. 7 and 9 are approximately 30 and 15, respectively. This suggests that mass transfer rates influence the rate in the batch reactor. The higher ratio of the reaction rates at higher temperature is probably due to intrinsic kinetic rate rising much more rapidly than the mass transfer rate with the rise in temperature resulting in the influence of mass transfer resistance becoming more predominant at higher temperature. As mentioned later in this work, in the microreactor intrinsic kinetics probably influences the reaction rate under our operating conditions, while both mass transfer and intrinsic kinetics probably influence the rate in the batch reactor, particularly at low temperature. While appreciable amount of by-products were found in the microreactor, no appreciable by- products were found in the microreactor. Burns and Ramshaw [8] conducted the nitration reaction of toluene in a microreactor with mixed acid and found that the mass transfer coefficient is much higher in the microreactor compared to a conventional reactor.

To compare the reaction rates of the microreactor and a batch reactor, we conducted the nitration reaction in a batch reactor made by PARR Instrument Company, model 5511 having a volume of 25 ml. It is made of stainless steel 316 and equipped with a magnetic drive stirrer. It has an electrical heating system and also a jacketed heating/cooling system. The reactor comes with, among other devices, a controller which can control the stirrer speed and reactor temperature, a pressure transducer and a sampling valve. For a batch run, initially 5 ml of 90 wt.% nitric acid was charged to the reactor. From a constant temperature water bath, water was circulated through

For a first order reaction in a plug flow reactor, the fractional conversion can be written as:

Stevens catalysts A and B were prepared at Stevens Institute of Technology with different SiO2 to Al2O3 ratio by sol–gel method. ZSM-5-280 in the hydrogen form (with a SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio of 280) was commercially obtained. It appears from the data that the conversion does not change much with residence time suggesting that the conversion is close to an equilibrium value. The conversion and the isomeric distribution appear to be very similar for all the three solid acids studied and the isomeric distribution is very similar to the isomeric distribution generally obtained in a mixed-acid toluene nitration. The low conversion obtained in the experiments may be explained as follows. Nitronium ion is responsible for the nitration of toluene with nitric acid. Marziano et al. [15] found that the concentration of nitronium ion is highly dependent on the nitric acid concentration. As the reaction progresses the acid is diluted due to the formation of water in the reaction, and nitronium ion concentration decreases. In fact, it has been observed that nitronium ion is nonexistent below certain concentration of nitric acid [16]. The catalyst bed length was very small compared to the total length of the microchannel after contacting the reactants. Thus, it appeared that in the microreactor set-up, most of the conversion took place outside the solid catalyst bed, and thus the effect of the solid catalysts on the isomeric distribution and conversion could not be established. To prove that most of the conversion took place outside the solid acid catalyst bed, we conducted experiments in an empty tube of 775 mm inner diameter and 120 cm long (after the T- mixer) in which the whole length of the tube from the T-mixer, except 5 cm at the exit portion for sample collection, was

isomers of nitrotuluene in the mononitration process. Sulfuric acid also acts as a water binder which enables this reaction to proceed towards completion. The drawback of this process is that a large amount of sulfuric acid is needed and the spent acid has to be regenerated because a simple neutralization is inconceivable nowadays for environmental and economic reasons. Liquid phase nitration of toluene is a two phase liquid–liquid reaction in which toluene diffuses to the aqueous acid phase and the reaction takes place in the acid phase [7]. Microreactors have been shown to have very high heat transfer rate due to the high surface area to volume ratio, which enables the microreactors to control highly exothermic reactions very efficiently. Also, due to high mass transfer rates in the microreactors compared to conventional reactors, the reactor productivity or reaction rate can be increased greatly in a microreactor over the conventional reactors for a multiphase reaction in which the reaction is limited by mass transfer. The enhanced mass transfer rate in a microreactor is due to circulation of small alternating slugs of the two liquids at very high speed as shown by Burns and Ramshaw [8] and Dummann et al. [9]. The efficient heat and mass transfer characteristics of a microreactor also enable the suppression of the formation of undesirable by-products. Burns and Ramshaw identified mass

The predicted conversions based on kinetically controlled rates given by Eq. (6) at different residence times at two temperatures of 22 8C and 60 8C are compared in Figs. 11 and 12 against the experimentally obtained conversions reported in Figs. 6 and 8. The predicted conversions based on reduced nitric acid concentration are converted to the conversion based on actual nitric acid concentration, which are shown in these figures. The experimental and predicted conversions are close enough to conclude that the reaction is kinetically controlled in

The effect of temperature on conversion is shown in Fig. 4. The flow rates were sufficiently low that final conversion was attained at the end of the reactor. It appears from these results that with decrease in temperature the conversion slightly increases. This may be due to increase in nitronium ion concentration with decrease in temperature as reported by Edwards and Fawcett [16]. We also conducted experiments by immersing the reactor in the water bath at 22 8C to find out the extent of the conversion

with PTFE fittings. The reactor was then immersed in a constant temperature water bath to obtain uniform reaction temperature. The tube connecting the reactor with the T-mixer had an inner diameter of 775 mm. From the constant temperature bath the mixture flowed to a product receiver where the product was collected in sodium carbonate solution to stop any further reaction. The tube used to connect the product receiver, and the reactor had also an inner diameter of 775 mm. The total length of the flow path after the T-Mixer was 220 cm and mainly consists of 775 mm inner diameter SS316L tube.

transfer controlled and kinetically controlled regimes for the nitration with mixed acid. The mass transfer rate in the microreactor can be high enough that the reaction can be controlled by intrinsic kinetics only. In this study, the liquid– liquid nitration of toluene is conducted with nitric acid alone in a microreactor in order to demonstrate that reaction rate in a microreactor is superior to that in conventional reactors for this reaction. Originally, we planned to study the effect of different ‘solid acid' catalysts, including ZSM-5, on the isomeric distribution in the nitration of toluene by concentrated nitric acid in a packed bed microreactor. The ZSM and other zeolite catalysts have been shown to increase the selectivity of p- nitrotoluene in a conventional reactor over the usual distribu- tion of the three nitrotoluenes found in a mixed-acid nitration as shown by Kowk et al. [10], Esakkidurai et al. [11], Vassena et al. [12] and Bernasconi et al. [13]. However, we found that the isomeric distribution using different solid acids packed in the microreactor was very similar to the mixed-acid nitration. It was also found that in the microreactor, concentrated nitric acid reacted very rapidly even at ambient temperature without any sulfuric acid or solid acid catalysts.

time preventing any temperature runaway due to its superior heat and mass transfer coefficients. By-products were also eliminated in the microreactor. However, with nitric acid alone as the nitrating agent, the yield of the nitrotoluenes is low due to the adverse dependency of water formed in the reaction on the nitronium ion concentration.

The results obtained in this work suggest that in the multiphase liquid–liquid nitration of toluene with 90 wt.% nitric acid, in a microreactor intrinsic kinetics probably controls the reaction rate under all the conditions studied in this work. From the comparison of the results of the microreactor with those of the batch reactor, both mass transfer and intrinsic kinetics rates influence the reaction rate at low temperature while mass transfer rate has more influence on the reaction rate at high temperatures. Thus, for this reaction much higher reaction rate, in orders of magnitude, could be obtained in a microreactor than in the conventional reactors while at the same
