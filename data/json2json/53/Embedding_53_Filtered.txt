of 4-NP, during which the inlet concentration of 4-NP was fixed at 1 mM. As shown in Fig. 6b, the Pd-30/UiO-66-NH2 microreactor with 0.10 wt% Pd shows over 99.1% conversion towards 4-NP at the flow rate of 10 μL/min. However, the conversion gradually decreased when increasing the flow rate from 10 to 60 μL/min, and the corresponding UV–vis spectra are shown in Fig. 6c. It is not surprising that the con- version is highest at the lowest flow rate, as the flow rate is opposite to the residence time, which reflects the contact time of the reactants with active components [29–30]. Thus, increasing the flow rate means

decreasing the residence time, leading to the decline of conversion. Compared with Pd-30/UiO-66-NH2 microreactor, the conversions of 4- NP catalyzed by Pd-60/UiO-66-NH2 (Pd loading: 0.19 wt%) are nearly 100% at the flow rates ranging from 10 to 40 μL/min, and it slightly declines to 99.4% and 98.5% when the flow rate shifts to 50 and 60 μL/ min, respectively (Fig. 6d). It is easy to understand that the Pd-60/UiO- 66-NH2 microreactor can provide enough Pd active components for the reaction, resulting in outstanding catalytic performance at the same condition. Generally speaking, long-term stability is an essential requirement for the industrial application of capillary reactors. To evaluate the stability of the microreactor, the long-term catalytic performance of Pd- 60/UiO-66-NH2 capillary microreactor was carried out at the flow rate of 30 μL/min and the inlet 4-NP concentration of 1 mM. The long-term operation was conducted for 100 h, during which samples of the outlet were collected every 2 h. Surprisingly, the conversion was always kept at nearly 100% during the entire reaction as shown in Fig. 7a, and this result demonstrates that the capillary microreactor is not only highly eﬃcient but also rather stable for the reduction reaction. SEM image of the surface view from spent Pd-60/UiO-66-NH2 film shows that this film does not peel oﬀ and is not destroyed despite long-time running (Fig. 7b). From cross-sectional EDX mapping analysis (Fig. 7c), the Pd NPs are still uniformly dispersed in the UiO-66-NH2 film. These results further confirm the excellent stability of the composite structures. The excellent stability is supposed to originate from the fact that the Pd NPs are firmly embedded in the strongly adhered UiO-66-NH2 film, which should naturally be attributed to our artful strategy for film growth and the high eﬃciency of UiO-66-NH2 for the immobilizing Pd NPs. The above results indicate that the prepared microreactor is a highly eﬃcient, stable and feasible micro-device, which has great potential to be applied for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in practical applications.

DI water was inleted by a flow rate of 3 mL/h to wash the channel for 5 min to remove the unstably immobilized Pd species. Thereafter, fresh NaBH4 aqueous solution (10 mM) was introduced at the flow rate of 2 mL/h for 3 h to reduce the Pd species into Pd NPs. Finally, the pre- pared microreactor was washed again by DI water at the flow rate of 3 mL/h for 30 min and dried at 373 K for 12 h to achieve Pd/UiO-66- NH2 film capillary microreactors for the following characterization and reaction.

As shown in Fig. 2, the resulting Pd/UiO-66-NH2 film microreactor was installed into the setup. 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) aqueous solution and freshly prepared NaBH4 solution were continuously fed into a tee joint at the same flow rate by two syringe pumps, respectively, and they were mixed into the film microreactor for the reduction reaction at 298 K. The residence time of the reaction was controlled by varying the total flow rate of mixtures in the microreactor. The total flow rate was set as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 μL/min, which corresponded to the residence time of 5.31, 2.66, 1.77, 1.33, 1.06 and 0.88 min, respectively. The products, collected from the microreactor outlet, were analyzed by re- cording absorbance at 399 nm in a quartz cuvette using UV–vis

Membrane/film microreactors, fabricated by assembling mem- branes/films in catalytic configurations with channels below 500 μm in diameter, have attracted increasing interest as highly eﬃcient hetero- geneous catalysts [1–5]. First of all, microreactor itself can oﬀer en- hanced catalytic performance due to its intrinsically higher mass and

After the modification, a precursor solution with a molar ratio of 1 ZrCl4/1 NH2-H2BDC/1 H2O/500 acetic acid/1000 DMF was prepared and pumped into the capillarytube at a constant flow rate of 0.4 mL/h at 393 K for desired time to obtain a continuous UiO-66-NH2 film. Fi- nally, the as-synthesized sample was washed by DMF and ethyl alcohol to obtain UiO-66-NH2 film microreactors. The thicknesses of the films were conveniently controlled by adjusting the synthesis time.

299 nm could be observed. The fractional conversion of 4-NP was cal- culated to be as high as 100%. This reveals that Pd NPs act as catalytic components on the UiO-66-NH2 film and show extremely high catalytic activity in this reduction reaction. In a microreactor, flow rate has a vital influence on the reaction conversion. To illustrate the dependency between conversion and flow rate, two microreactors with diﬀerent Pd contents (marked as Pd-30/ UiO-66-NH2 and Pd-60/UiO-66-NH2) have been prepared by changing the flow time for Pd NPs immobilization and then used in the reduction

2.2. Fabrication of Pd/UiO-66-NH2 film microreactors by the flow method

The reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) was utilized to evaluate the catalytic performance of the achieved Pd/UiO- 66-NH2 film microreactor. For comparison, the UiO-66-NH2 film mi- croreactor without any Pd catalysts was also investigated for the re- duction of 4-NP at the flow rate of 40 μL/min. As shown in Fig. 6a, the absorption peak of 4-NP just slightly drops compared with the original peak of initial 4-NP at 399 nm. No absorption peak of product 4-AP at 299 nm could be seen, indicating that the UiO-66-NH2 film merely served as catalyst support. As for the slight drop of the absorption peak of 4-NP, the reason can be attributed to the enhanced mass transfer in the microchannel with porous UiO-66-NH2 film and may be considered as a regular behavior [27]. In general, 4-NP firstly reacts with NaBH4 to produce more reactive 4-nitrophenolate ion (4-NPI), and then 4-NPI converts into 4-AP with the help of Pd catalysts [28]. As expected, for the Pd-60/UiO-66-NH2 film microreactor containing 0.19 wt% of Pd under the same operation conditions, only absorption peak of 4-AP at

2.2.2. Immobilization of Pd NPs inside the UiO-66-NH2 film by flow Pd species were incorporated into UiO-66-NH2 film to form a Pd/ UiO-66-NH2 film as shown in the setup of Fig. 2. The H2PdCl4 aqueous solution (6 mg L−1), prepared by dissolving PdCl2 into HCl aqueous solution, was pumped into the UiO-66-NH2 film coated capillary mi- croreactor at room temperature (298 K). In order to achieve the Pd/ UiO-66-NH2 films with diﬀerent Pd contents, the operations were conducted at the flow rate of 1 mL/h for 30 min and 60 min, respec- tively (remarked as Pd-30/UiO-66-NH2 and Pd-60/UiO-66-NH2). Then,

In summary, a facile and convenient flow method is developed to fabricate a highly eﬃcient Pd/UiO-66-NH2 film capillary microreactor for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP. This strategy is based on both the flow growth of UiO-66-NH2 film on the inner wall modified with APTES and anchoring of Pd NPs by functional amino-group of UiO-66-NH2, leading to a continuous and uniform UiO-66-NH2 film as well as evenly dispersed and stably fixed Pd NPs in the film. Moreover, both film thickness and loading amount of Pd NPs can be readily adjusted by changing operation time. The resultant Pd/UiO-66-NH2 film capillary microreactor also retains a conversion of approximate 100% for the reduction of 4-NP during the continuous flow reaction even for 100 h, demonstrating excellent catalytic activity and stability. Our strategy, integrating both MOFs film and Pd NPs into microchannel, has fully exhibited its superiorities in catalysis applications. And it may be ex- tended to the fabrication of other MOFs film-based microchannel loaded with diﬀerent active components and thus more kinds of eﬃ- cient microreactors can be achieved.

A novel Pd/UiO-66-NH2 film quartz capillary microreactor was fabricated by a flow method in which fine control of the film thickness and metal loading could be readily achieved by adjusting flow time. Firstly, UiO-66- NH2 film as the catalyst support layer was synthesized on the inner wall of the quartz capillary employing a two- step procedure including surface modification with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and the subsequent flow growth of UiO-66-NH2 film. Secondly, Pd nanoparticles (NPs) were uniformly and firmly immobilized in the UiO-66-NH2 film as active catalysts using the same flow method. Such Pd/UiO-66-NH2 film capillary micro- reactor was applied as catalyst for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to produce 4-aminophenol (4-AP) under continuous flow conditions. Nearly 100% conversion was achieved under mild conditions in a short residence time. Importantly, no deactivation was observed for this microreactor during the continuous flow reaction of 100 h, indicating its excellent stability due to the firm immobilization of active Pd NPs in UiO-66-NH2 film.

heat transfer rate [6]. Then, the introduction of membrane/film in microreactors can realize the immobilization and uniform dispersion of catalytic active components, and achieve supra-equilibrium conver- sions, resulting in intensified production processes and greatly im- proved reaction eﬃciency [7,8]. Furthermore, the coated membrane/ film, as a protective layer, can also prevent metal nanocatalysts from deactivation by avoiding aggregation and leaching of active

nanoparticles [9,10]. Such membrane/film-based microreactors can generally be synthesized either by static method or under flow condi- tion. The latter approach is preferred over the former one because of its merits in achieving continuous and uniform membrane/film layers on the inner surface of the microreactors with huge ratio of length to diameter. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by the periodic co- ordination of metal ions/clusters and ligands, possess uniform micro- porous structure, large surface areas and even some acidic or basic sites [11,12]. These advantages have inspired researchers to explore their potential as membrane/film substrates for loading catalytically active components. For example, Mao et al. [9] firstly employed HKUST-1, a MOF material, in the form of film to immobilize various functional particles (metal nanoparticles, inorganic, polymers, proteins and so on) for catalysis and bio-activity application. Zamaro and co-workers [10] achieved ZIF-8 films on microchannel copper foils to support Ag na- noparticles and then conducted the composite films as high-perfor- mance catalysts in the CO oxidation. Despite the eﬀorts have been devoted, much work still needs to be done on more types of appropriate MOFs to explore their potential as membrane/film supports in micro- reactors. The UiO-66 family, composed of Zr6O4(OH)4 cluster and carboxylate ligands, exhibits exceptional chemical and thermal stabi- lities [13,14]. Besides, UiO-66 and its derivative materials are also widely used as supports to encapsulate active catalytic species [15–18]. Therefore, these Zr-based crystalline materials may serve as a promising candidate for membrane/film substrates. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few reports about the coating of UiO-66 series MOFs on microchannels as membrane/film microreactors for catalytic application. In the present work, a facile flow method was developed to fabricate a highly eﬃcient capillary quartz microreactor based on Pd nano- particles (NPs) immobilized in UiO-66-NH2 film (named as Pd/UiO-66- NH2 film) for 4-nitrophenol reduction. As shown in Fig. 1, the method involves a two-step procedure including the growth of a continuous UiO-66-NH2 film on the inner surface of quartz capillary, followed by immobilizing active Pd species inside the UiO-66-NH2 film. The thick- ness of the UiO-66-NH2 film and the loading content of Pd NPs could be conveniently optimized by adjusting the operation time to achieve highly eﬃcient capillary microreactor. This method covered three key points: 1) APTES was employed to chemically modify the inner surface of the quartz capillary with active nucleation and growth sites for the formation of a continuous and uniform UiO-66-NH2 film; 2) porous
