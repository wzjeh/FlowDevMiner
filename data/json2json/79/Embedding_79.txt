microreactor length because of increased catalyst loading and residence time. The obtained results reveal that the developed gas–liquid–solid microreactor can not only yield high conver- sion but also promote the durability.

The experimental results showed the developed gas–liquid– solid microreactor was able to yield good catalytic activity. However, as one of the key points reecting the performance of the microreactor, the durability of the microreactor fabricated by this method remains unknown. For this reason, particular attention of this work was paid to the evaluation of the dura- bility of the gas–liquid–solid microreactor fabricated by this method under various operation conditions. For comparison, the diﬀerences in the chemical composition and morphology as well as the performance between the catalyst layer without and with further hydrogen reduction under diﬀerent operational conditions were studied.

solid microreactors are still limited by poor durability. Hence, in this work, a method for the preparation

hand, the increased ow rate means that more reactants participated the reaction and more intermediates and by- products were generated, which intensied both the adsorp- tion of the intermediates and by-products on the active sites. Thereby, the durability of the microreactor was lowered. On the other hand, the low ow rate means longer residence time in the microreactor, which not only allowed the reactants eﬀec- tively to contact with the catalyst but also lowered the load to the microreactor system. Thus, although the active sites were adsorbed by those intermediates and by-products, the overall supply of the reactants was small so that the overall amount of generated intermediates and by-products was reduced. There- fore, a stable and high nitrobenzene conversion could still be acquired, indicated the commendable durability of the micro- reactor. Attributed to these two reasons, low ow rate can perform a high durability for the given nitrobenzene concen- tration and microreactor length. The durability is decreased with the increase of the ow rates. 3.4.3 Microreactor length. The length of the microreactor is another important factor aﬀecting the durability of the microreactor because of the diﬀerence in the catalyst loading, active surface area and the residence time. To study the eﬀect of the microreactor length, in this section, the inlet nitrobenzene concentration was kept at 30 mM, the gas and liquid ow rates were set at 0.15 sccm and 15 mL min�1, respectively. Two microreactor lengths of 0.5 m and 1.0 m were chosen. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 10, which indicated that the durability of the microreactor with large length was better than that with short length. This is because increasing the length of the microreactor increased the total catalyst loading and the active sites in the whole microreactor. Although the catalyst deactivation was unavoidable, excess catalyst could provide enough active sites for the promotion of the durability. On the other hand, the increased length of the microreactor increased the residence times of both the gas and liquid reac- tants in the microreactor, which also contributed to high nitrobenzene conversion even aer a long-term operation.

where the channel volume was about 280 mL as given. Based on this denition, the residence times corresponding to the ow rates were determined to be about 336 s, 112 s and 67.2 s, respectively. Large residence time corresponds to a low ow rate. Fig. 9 shows the variation in the nitrobenzene conversion with the ow rates. Obviously, at low ow rate corresponding to the residence time of 336 s, the nitrobenzene conversion was as high as 97% in the entire operation period. When the gas and liquid ow rate were set at 15 mL min�1 and 0.15 sccm, which corresponded to the residence time of 112 s, the nitrobenzene conversion was stable in the rst 28 h and then gradually declined. With the further increase of the ow rates, the period with stable and high nitrobenzene conversion was further decreased. The diﬀerence in the nitrobenzene conversion between the ow rates may be attributed to two aspects. On one

To further evaluate the durability of the fabricated catalyst layer, the eﬀects of the inlet nitrobenzene concentration, the ow rate as well as the length of the microreactor were also investigated in this work. 3.4.1 Inlet nitrobenzene concentration. In this section, the inlet nitrobenzene concentration ranged from 30 mM to 90 mM. The ow rates of the gas and liquid reactants were kept at 0.15 sccm and 15 mL min�1, respectively. The length of the micro- reactor was 1.0 m. Note that the supplied hydrogen under this ow rate can ensure the supplied nitrobenzene to be completely converted. Fig. 8 shows the eﬀect of the inlet nitrobenzene concentration on the nitrobenzene conversion over the entire operation period of 40 h. As can be seen, at the 30 mM opera- tion, over the entire operation period, the nitrobenzene conversion was kept stable without obvious decrease and the average nitrobenzene conversion was about 97%. With the inlet nitrobenzene concentration increased to 60 mM, the nitroben- zene conversion was kept stable in the rst 28 h with an average nitrobenzene conversion of about 97% and then gradually declined to about 60% in the next 9 h. And when the inlet

concentration was further increased to 90 mM, the nitroben- zene conversion was rather stable in the rst 23 h and then gradually declined as the operation time went on. It is clear that high nitrobenzene conversion could be obtained during the stable stage for each inlet nitrobenzene concentration, while the durability of the microreactor was decreased with increasing the inlet nitrobenzene concentration. As discussed above, nearly all Pd ions adsorbed on the PDA surface had been reduced and a large amount of Pd nanoparticles was uniformly dispersed on the surface (see Fig. 5 and 6), which provided a large number of catalytically active sites for the nitrobenzene hydrogenation. Thus, high conversion in the rst stage could be obtained even at the nitrobenzene concentration of 90 mM. However, with the increase of the inlet nitrobenzene concen- tration, more intermediates and by-products were generated during the catalytic reaction process, which would not only cover the active sites of the catalysts but also aggravate the agglomeration of the Pd nanocatalysts.38 It is indicated that the decrease of the active sites exposed to the reactants hindered the catalytic reaction. Under such a circumstance, less and less nitrobenzene could be converted to aniline. The nitrobenzene conversion was lower and lower and eventually the catalytic reaction stopped. As a result, the durability of the catalyst layer inside the microreactor decreased with the increase of the inlet nitrobenzene concentration. 3.4.2 Flow rate. Variations in both the liquid and gas ow rates can cause the changes of both the residence time and the load of the microreactor and thus aﬀect the microreactor performance. In this section, therefore, the eﬀect of the ow rates was investigated. In this experiment, the inlet nitroben- zene concentration of 60 mM and the microreactor length of 1.0 m were selected. To ensure the analogical gas–liquid two- phase ow pattern in the microreactor and suﬃcient supply of hydrogen for complete conversion, the ow rate ratio of gas to liquid was kept at 10. The liquid ow rates ranged from 5 mL min�1 to 25 mL min�1, with the corresponding gas ow rate ranging from 0.05 sccm, to 0.25 sccm, respectively. Because of the diﬀerence between the gas and liquid ow rates, the resi- dence time of the reactants in the microreactor was dened as,

To date, numerous studies have been carried out to investi- gate the microreactor technologies for various catalytic reac- tions, such as the catalytic oxidation,12 the catalytic hydrogenation,6 the catalytic combustion,13 etc. It has been found that the property of the prepared catalyst layer inside the microreactor is crucial to aﬀect the microreactor performance. Therefore, a variety of attempts have been made to prepare the

Durability, as one of the important indicators to evaluate the performance of the catalyst layer in the microreactor, plays a critical role in the industrial applications. Thus, a long-term operation was carried out for the durability characterizations of the catalyst layers with and without further hydrogen reduction. In this test, the inlet nitrobenzene concentration was kept at 60 mM, hydrogen and nitrobenzene ow rates were set at 0.15 sccm and 15 mL min�1, respectively. The variations of the nitrobenzene conversion with the operation time are shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen, for the catalyst layer without hydrogen reduction, during the rst 3 h operation, the average nitro- benzene conversion could reach over 97%, but it was decreased to 50.5% with further increasing the operation time. However, for the catalyst layer with further reduction by hydrogen, over the entire operation period of 37 h, the nitrobenzene conversion could be kept stable during the rst 28 h operation with an average nitrobenzene conversion of about 97% and then declined gradually to 60.03% in the next 9 h operation. These results indicated that the catalyst layer prepared with hydrogen reduction could not only perform an excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene but also showed much better durability than did the one without hydrogen reduction.

Multiphase catalytic reactions, such as catalytic cracking, cata- lytic reforming, catalytic hydrogenation, etc., have been widely used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.1–4 In these applications, to reduce the potential mass transfer resistance between the phases and improve the reaction rate, the pressure or/and temperature are usually increased, which will increase not only the explosion potential but also the processing and manufacturing costs.5 Microreactors have an intrinsically large interfacial area per unit volume and have proven to be able to dramatically enhance heat and mass transfer as well as reduce the explosion potential, making them suitable for multiphase catalytic reactions.6–11

the collected K2PdCl4 solution aer deposition. The result is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the solutions before and aer the deposition both showed a peak at 416 nm in the UV-vis spectrum, which corresponded to palladium ions.31 The absorbance decreased from 1.62 to 0.86 aer the deposition, indicating that the concentration of the palladium ions in the collected K2PdCl4 solution was about 2.65 mM. Considering that about 360 mL 5 mM K2PdCl4 solution was introduced into the microreactor for the Pd deposition, the content of Pd cata- lyst in the microreactor was thus estimated to be about 90 mg (4.77 mg cm�2).

hydrogen reduction. Besides, the Pd particle size was large, making it a little diﬃcult to agglomerate during the operation. Hence, it could perform a much better durability for the nitro- benzene hydrogenation compared with the catalyst layer without hydrogen reduction. In addition, we also compared the catalytic performance and durability of the catalysts fabricated in this study with those conventional methods and the results are listed in Table 1. As shown, in comparison to the catalyst layer in the conventional microreactors and the catalyst in the batch reactor, the catalysts fabricated by the proposed method in this work exhibited not only high nitrobenzene conversion but also relatively good durability. It is further demonstrated that the method proposed in this study shows the promising potential for future industrial applications.

Generally, catalysts prepared by these methods could guarantee high activity. However, the calcination process during the fabrication is typically required to improve the adhesion with the substrate, which not only increases the manufacturing cost and potential risk but also limits the selection of materials. In addition to the catalytic activity, the durability of the fabricated catalyst layer is another key issue, which directly aﬀects the industrial applications of the microreactor technologies. Unfortunately, the durability of the existing catalyst layers inside the microreactor fabricated by the conventional methods is still poor.17,18 Therefore, facile methods are needed for preparing catalyst layer with good durability and activity in the microreactors. To address the above-mentioned issues, extensive eﬀorts have been devoted to this area. For example, Kobayashi et al.6

immobilized the polymer encapsulated Pd nanoparticles inside the glass-fabricated microreactor. Hornung et al.19–21 deposited the metal nanoparticles on the polyelectrolyte using layer by layer self-assembly technology. Although signicant progress has been made, there still exist problems of relatively low activity or substrate selectivity to the catalyst. Previous studies22,23 have indicated that adhesive proteins secreted by mussels are able to attach onto virtually various substrates,

Commercially available PTFE (polytetrauoroethylene) tube with the inner diameter of 0.6 mm and outer diameter of 1.0 mm was used to fabricate the microreactor. Dopamine hydrochloride and Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Inc (Shanghai, China) and GEN-VIEW Scientic Inc (Florida, USA), respectively. Palladium chloride was obtained from Sino-Platinum Metals Co. Ltd (Kunming, China). Potassium chloride, ethanol, nitro- benzene were acquired from Chongqing Chuandong Chemical Co. Ltd (Chongqing, China). The chemicals were analytical reagent grade and used as-received. Deionized water was ob- tained from an Ultrapure Water System for Laboratory (ROMB, China).

In this stage, 5 mM K2PdCl4 aqueous solution prepared by dissolving PdCl2 and KCl in water (PdCl2: 886.65 mg mL�1 and KCl: 372.75 mg mL�1), was used as the precursor solution. The precursor solution was inltrated into the PTFE tube with coated PDA layer at a ow rate of 50 mL min�1. Once the tube was full of the precursor solution, the ow rate of the precursor solution was then changed to 0.1 mL min�1 and maintained for 12 h to adsorb and reduce the Pd ions. Aer that, excess amount of water was fed into the PTFE tube several times at a ow rate of 10 mL min�1 to the remove of residual ions, which was followed by ushing with nitrogen gas at a ow rate of 0.1 sccm for 5– 10 min to remove the remaining water. Finally, the resulting PTFE tube was placed into a vacuum tube resistance furnace (Tianjin Zhonghuan Lab Furnace Co., Ltd, China) and heated in the H2 environment under 473 K for 4 h to further reduce the residual Pd ions to metallic nanoparticles. The obtained sample was denoted as Pd-PDA/PTFE in the following discussion. To estimate the Pd content in the microreactor, a UV-visible spec- trophotometer (T6-1650E, Persee, China) with the wavelength range from 190 nm to 1100 nm at 1 nm resolution was used to measure the diﬀerence between the 5 mM K2PdCl4 solution and
