In this article, to miniaturize the hydrogenation reactor and make the H2O2 produc- tion with more safety a gas-liquid microdispersion system was generated to intensify the process of catalytic hydrogenation of ethylanthraquinone by passing the gas-liquid microdispersion system through a generally packed bed reactor. A microdispersion de- vice with a 5 lm pore size microfiltration membrane as the dispersion medium has been developed and microbubbles in the size of 10–100 lm were successfully gener- ated. The reaction and mass transfer performance was evaluated. The conversion of ethylanthraquinone as much as 35% was realized in less than 3.5 s. The overall vol- ume mass transfer coefficient in the microdispersion reaction system reached in the range of 1–21 s�1, more than two orders of magnitude larger than the values in nor- mal gas-liquid trickle-bed reactors. A mathematical model in the form of Sh ¼ 2.0 þ 54.7Sc1/3We1/2U1/10 has been firstly suggested, which can well predict the overall mass transfer coefficient.

hydrogenated to 2-ethylanthrahydroquinone (EAQH2), with Pd or Ni as catalyst. H2O2 is then produced by the oxidation of EAQH2 with O2 in air. In addition to participating in the main reaction, EAQH2 can also be converted to tetrahydro- 2-ethylanthrahydroquinone (H4EAQH2) by further hydrogen- ation. As shown in Figure 1b, H4EAQ can also be used as ‘hydrogen carrier', forming H4EAQ cycle route of H2O2 pro- duction. EAQH2 may also take part in some side reactions, as shown in Figure 1c. In the Reidl-Pfleiderer process, catalytic hydrogenation of EAQ is the key reaction in the synthesis of H2O2, in which efficient gas-liquid mixing and high mass transfer perform- ance are demanded. As reported by Santacesaria et al.,8 cata- lytic hydrogenation of antraquinone is a fast reaction and the reaction rate is controlled by the mass transfer resistance in conventional reactors. The enhancement of mass transfer can lead to higher reaction rate in catalytic hydrogenation of

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a popular oxidizing agent, not only for its efficient oxidizing,1,2 but also for its signifi- cant environmental friendliness as the by-product of oxida- tion reactions is water.3,4 In commercial, Reidl-Pfleiderer process, which has a significant advantage of avoiding direct contact of H2 and O2, is widely used to produce hydrogen peroxide. Reactions involved in this process have been described by Drelinkiewicz et al.5 and Halder and Lawal6

The main reaction is shown as Figure 1a, in which 2-ethyl- 9,10-anthraquinone (EAQ) is used as ‘hydrogen carrier'. In this process, EAQ dissolved in an organic solvent is first

in 500–1500 lm and accordingly the overall mass transfer coefficient ranged from 4 � 10�4 to 1.6 � 10�3 m/s. The decrease in dispersion size will possibly lead to further intensification of the catalytic hydrogenation process, because mass transfer is the rate-controlling step. In our pre- vious study, a microfiltration membrane has been used as at high throughput dispersion medium, to enhance the mass transfer performance in gas/liquid21 and liquid/liquid22 heter- ogeneous systems as well as the mixing process in liquid– liquid homogeneous systems.23–25 In these studies, the dispersion size ranged in 10 to 20 times of the nominal pore size of the microfiltration membrane and the microdispersion systems did demonstrate very high mass transfer rate and good mixing efficiency. In this study, for realizing the application of microdisper- sion reactions in large scale processes, a 5 lm pore size microfiltration membrane was used as the dispersion medium to form microbubble-in-liquid system. The gas-liquid micro- dispersion system flowed through a packed bed reactor, which was filled with Pd-Al2O3 particles inside, to realize catalytic hydrogenation of EAQ. The reaction and mass transfer performance was evaluated and the effects of flow rates, addition of inertial gas (N2 as example), partial pres- sure of H2, EAQ concentration and reaction temperature on them were studied. The mass transfer performance was com- pared with traditional equipment, and a new correlation was set up to predict the mass transfer performance, by consider- ing the influence of diffusion coefficient, microdispersion

EAQ and thus the reduction of reactor volume. Thus, the enhancement of mass transfer will possibly lead to a reaction process with higher safety, lower cost and higher environ- mental friendship, which is an expected direction. Since the 21st century, microreactors have caught the attention of many researchers for its intensification of mixing and mass transfer rates9,10 and have been used to realize multiphase reactions efficiently.11–16 In particular, catalytic hydrogenation has been carried out in microchannel reac- tors17 and micro-packed-bed reactors,18,19 showing much higher reaction rate than in conventional reactors. Catalytic hydrogenation of EAQ in a microreactor has been studied by Halder and Lawal,6 in which a T-junction microchannel was used to form a gas-in-liquid microdispersion system, and a following micro-packed-bed reactor was used to carry out the catalytic hydrogenation, showing much higher reactor space-time yield than in conventional reactors. The study6

indicates that the bubble-in-liquid microdispersion system leads to the process intensification of catalytic hydrogena- tion, by enhancing the mass transfer process, showing that the reaction rate is controlled by mass transfer even in the microchannel reactor. However, the effect of dispersion state on mass transfer performance in packed-bed reactor or catalytic hydrogenation reaction of EAQ have not been investigated yet. As described in literature,20 when a T-junc- tion microchannel is used to form gas-liquid dispersion sys- tem to realize the physical absorption of CO2 with water, the dispersion size, i.e. the equivalent diameter of bubble, ranges

A back pressure valve [(0 to 1.0) MPa range] was used to control the outlet pressure of the phase separator to the required pressure. A pressure sensor (0–0.5 MPa, with the accuracy of �0.5%) was installed before the back pressure valve to determine the total pressure of the gas phase.

Only fresh EAQ solution was used as solute in all the experiment, to avoid the effect of the degradation products. The solvent of EAQ solution was a mixture of 1,2,4-trimethyl- benzene and trioctyl phosphate with the weight ratio of 1:2.6. EAQ, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and trioctyl phosphate were all reagent grade and purchased from Beijing Chemical Plant. Hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen (N2) were taken as the gas components. H2 and N2 used in the experiment were all with purity of 99.995 mol % were purchased from Beijing Huayuan Gas Chemical Industry. The catalyst used in this study was 0.3% � 0.02% (w/w) Pd supported on Al2O3 and was provided by Sinopec Group.

process and gas volume fraction, which potentially helps the design of the new process.

The experimental set-up is shown in Figure 2. The mem- brane dispersion module was fabricated by stainless steel. A stainless steel microfiltration membrane (Figure 3) with 5 lm average pore size and 0.3 mm thickness was used as the dispersion medium. The active membrane area was 10 mm2. The size of the flow channel was 15 mm � 2 mm � 3 mm. The size of the gas buffer reservoir was 10 mm � 5 mm � 10 mm. The liquid phase was pumped into the top side of the membrane (the flow channel) while the gas phase was pumped into the gas chamber. Under the action of pressure difference, the gas phase was dispersed as microsize bubbles when it passed through the membrane into the liquid phase to form a microdispersion system. The formed microdispersion system flowed out of the membrane dispersion module and into a tubular reactor packed with Al2O3-supported-palladium-catalyst. The reactor was made of stainless steel tube with an inner diameter of 10 mm and a length of 50cm filled with catalyst particles. The size of the catalyst particles was around 3 mm and the bulk density was in the range of (0.63 � 0.05) g/mL. In this study, 20.44 g of supported catalyst containing 0.3% � 0.02% (w/w) palladium were used. The reactor was connected to a phase separator with an inner diameter of 10 mm and height of 30 cm. The gas-liq- uid system flowed into the phase separator from the middle position and was separated into gas-phase and liquid-phase almost immediately for the larger density difference of the two phases. The separated gas-phase and liquid-phase flowed out of the separator from the top and bottom respectively. An advection pump [(0–100) mL/min, with a measure- ment accuracy of �1%] was used to pump the liquid phase into the microcontactor. Two mass flowmeters (0-500 SCCM, with a measurement accuracy of �1.5%) were used to control feeding gases with stable pressure and flow rate- s.Three water baths (room temperature �100�C, with a reso-

The microbubble size was measured using a high-speed CCD video camera which was connected to the microscope with magnification of 40. The liquid product was analyzed with the same method as described in literature.6 The liquid product was oxidized com- pletely by O2 until the color of the solution completely changed, extracted twice with 1% (w/w) phosphoric acid and titrated with standard potassium permanganate solution with the con- centration of 0.026 mol/L, to determine the concentration of total hydrogenated anthraquinones. The accuracy of titration is 0.02 mL of standard potassium permanganate solution.

where, CEAQH2 is the concentration of EAQH2 after reaction, which is determined by assuming EAQH2 to be the only product of hydrogenation, mol/L; CEAQ,0 is the initial concentration of EAQ, mol/L. As reported in the literature,6,8 catalytic hydrogenation of antraquinone is a fast reaction and the reaction rate is con- trolled by the mass transfer process. Thus the control step of this reaction process is assumed to be mass transfer here. The overall volume mass transfer coefficient, KLa, is calcu- lated by Eq. 2

where KLa is the overall volume mass transfer coefficient, s�1; R is the overall reaction rate in the liquid phase, mol/(m3 s); C� H2 is the average saturated solubility of H2 in the solvent, mol/m3, which is calculated by

Considering the similarity of H2 solubility in organic sol- vent, the solubility of H2 in organic solution in this study is considered to be the same value as H2 in working solution in which the mixture of n-hexane and xylene is used as sol- vent, as described as following26

QL, at a constant phase ratio. As shown in our previous study,27 the dispersion size is proportional to Q�0:20 L . As the increase in the flow rate of liquid phase, the dispersion size decreases, which leads to higher mass-transfer area as well as thinner liquid film around bubbles. The decrease in the thickness of liquid film causes the decrease in mass-transfer residence. Both the increase in mass-transfer area and the decrease in mass-transfer residence, cause the increase in KLa together. The model which describes the experimental results is developed further and it will be discussed later.

where pH2 is the partial pressure of H2 in the gas phase. The effect of the H2 volume flow rate, Q (H2), for a cer- tain phase ratio at different molar ratio of H2 to EAQ, on the conversion of EAQ, is shown in Figures 4–6a, when the reaction temperature of 30, 50, and 60�C, respectively. In all the temperature and molar ratio, the conversion increases with the increase of the flow rate at first, possibly due to the increase in specific interfacial area. As shown in Figure 7, the bubble size and dispersity both decrease with increasing liquid phase flow rate at a constant gas phase flow rate. As the flow rate increases further, the conversion begins to decrease due to the reduction in residence time. The overall volume mass transfer coefficient according to the situation of Figures 4–6a is shown in Figures 4–6b. KLa increases with the increase in the flow rate of liquid phase,

As described in the literature,28 the addition of inert com- ponent (N2 as a best choice) will increase the stability of the pressure drop in the trickle bed as well as the selectivity of the catalyst. Thus, N2 is added in the gas feed in this study and the effect of the volume fraction of N2 in the feed of

tio decreases, and the thickness of the liquid film around the bubble increases, leading to the increase in the mass-transfer residence and the decrease in KLa. The model which describes the experimental results is developed further and it will be discussed later.

The effect of EAQ concentration on the conversion of EAQ and the concentration of H2O2 in the product, at a con- stant molar ratio of H2 to EAQ, are shown in Figures 10a, b, respectively. The conversion of EAQ decreases significantly while the concentration of H2O2 in the product increases slightly as the increase in EAQ concentration. The overall volume mass transfer coefficient accordingly is shown in Figure 10c, indicating that KLa increases as the increase in EAQ concentration. As the increase in EAQ con- centration, the gas-to-liquid flow rate ratio, and the thickness of the liquid film around the bubble increases, leading to the decrease in the mass-transfer residence and the increase in KLa. The model which describes the experimental results is developed further and it will be discussed later.

gas phase is investigated here. As shown in Figure 8a, when keeping a constant H2 partial pressure (the total pressure at the outlet is adjusted to keep a constant H2 partial pressure) and molar ratio of H2 to EAQ, the addition of N2 does not show significant influence on the conversion. It is worth not- ing that the conversion of EAQ reaches about 35% in less than 3.5 s when the liquid flow rate is 12 mL/min, while the time required to reach the same conversion in conventional reactor is about 1.27 min, as reported in literature.28 The overall volume mass transfer coefficient accordingly is shown in Figure 8b, indicating that the addition of N2 does not show influence on KLa.

transfer and thus the design of the reactors for this kind of reaction. In the literature, some correlations have been devel- oped to predict the mass transfer performance from the liq- uid to the surface of solid, in most of which viscosity force and inertial force are considered to be the main factors affecting the mass transfer process and dimensionless num- bers of Sc and Rep are usually used to predict Sh. The dimensionless numbers of Sc, Rep, and Sh are defined as Eqs. 5–8

where v is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid, m2/s; D is the diffusion coefficient of the component in liquid, m2/s. Considering the similarity of the diffusion coefficient of H2 in organic solvent, the diffusion coefficient of H2 in organic solution in this study is considered to be the same value as H2 in working solution in which the mixture of n-hexane and xylene is used as solvent, as described as following26

Such values are more than two orders of magnitude larger than the values for laboratory trickle-bed29

The great improvement of KLa is possibly due to the large interfacial area and short mass transfer distance caused by the microsized dispersion and leads to the good performance in catalytic reaction process. The correlation of KLa will help for the prediction the process in catalyzed gas-liquid reactions controlled by mass

as in literature.31 However, the two correlations above can not be used in this microdispersion system, for Sh calculated by experimental data is almost more than 5 times higher than the predicted value, as shown in Figure 12. The significant deviation indicates that the correlations are not suitable for the microdispersion system, which is possibly caused by the different flow patterns between liquid-flow-through-solid-surface and foam-flow-through-solid- surface. In the traditional device, the gas phase and liquid phase concurrently flow through the packed bed, thus the mass transfer process from gas phase to solid surface is con- trolled by the mass transfer of gas dissolved in the liquid from gas-liquid interface to liquid-solid interface. The main fac- tors affecting this mass-transfer process are: the diffusion coefficient of gas in liquid (affecting on the rate of diffu- sion mass transfer) and the flow condition of the liquid (affecting on the convective mass transfer). Thus, Rep and Sc are used in the correlation to predict the mass-transfer coefficient in liquid-flow-through-solid-surface flow pattern. When the gas phase is dispersed as microbubbles into the liquid phase before passing through packed bed, the new flow pattern of foam-flow-through-solid-surface is formed. The flow condition and thickness of the liquid film on parti- cle surface will be different from the traditional process. The microbubble-in-liquid system with the new flow pattern could be considered to be a uniform fluid, which passes through the solid surface and forms fluid/solid system. As is well known that the diffusivity in the liquid phase is much lower than in the gas phase, thus, the controlling step of external mass-transfer is mass transfer of the gas dis- solved in the liquid through the liquid film to the solid sur- face. In this case, Sh number could be calculated with KL and the diffusivity D. D could be considered as the gas dif- fusivity in the liquid phase, which can be determined by Eq. 6. For the new flow pattern, mass transfer will be affected by new factors and new correlation needs to be developed. As shown in Figures 4–6b, KLa increases with the increase in the flow rate of liquid phase, QL, at a constant phase ratio, which is possibly due to the decrease in the liq- uid film thickness on the particle surface. On the other hand, as shown in our previous study,27 the microbubble size is proportional to Q�0:20 L , thus the increase of KLa is possibly due to the decrease in the dispersion size and thus the

increase in gas-liquid interfacial area. As shown in Figures 7–9b, KLa does not change at constant flow rates and decreases with the increase in the gas-to-liquid phase ratio at a constant liquid flow rate, QL. The effect of phase ratio on KLa is possibly due to the decrease in the thickness of the liq- uid film as the increase in the phase ratio. As shown in Figure 10b, KLa increases slightly with the increase in temperature, possibly due to the decrease in the liquid film thickness too. As described above, the main factors affecting the mass trans- fer performance of foam-flow-through-solid-surface are: the foam flow condition and the thickness of the liquid film. The liquid film is determined by two factors: the size of the dispersed bubbles and the gas-to-liquid flow rate ratio. As described above, there are new factors effecting the mass- transfer process in the flow pattern of foam-flow-through- solid-surface: inertial force, which affecting on the dispersion size, and gas-to-liquid flow rate ratio, which affecting on the thickness of the liquid film around bubbles. Thus We and U are introduced into the new empirical equation, instead of Rep, in which We and U are defined as Eqs. 11 and 12

In this article, a gas-liquid microdispersion device with a 5 lm pore size microfiltration membrane as the dispersion me- dium has been developed to generate gas-liquid microdisper- sion systems for process intensification of catalytic hydrogena- tion of ethylanthraquinone. Using the device microbubbles in the size of 10–100 lm were successfully generated with ethyl- anthraquinone solution as the continuous phase. The reaction and mass transfer performance was evaluated and the effects of flow rates, addition of inertial gas (N2 as example), partial pressure of H2, EAQ concentration and reaction temperature on them were studied. By passing the gas-liquid microdisper- sion system through a packed bed reactor the conversion of ethylanthraquinone as much as 35% was reached in less than 3.5 s. The overall volume mass transfer coefficient in the microdisperion system was calculated and the value ranged in 1–21 s�1, which is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the values in the normal gas-liquid trickle-bed reaction processes. The results indicate that gas-liquid microdispersion can make great improvement to solid catalyzed gas-liquid reactions which are controlled by mass transfer. An equation has been developed to correlate the mass transfer in the flow pattern of foam-flow-through-solid-surface with diffusion coefficient, inertial force, thickness of the liquid film and bub- ble size, which shows good coincidence with experimental values. The research may provide an effective way to minia- turize the hydrogenation reactor and make the H2O2 produc- tion with more safety.
