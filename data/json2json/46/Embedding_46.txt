On the basis of studying the effect of independent parameters on synthesis of 2-EHN in the microreactor, a series of experiments were carried out to optimize the reaction conditions to offer more information for industrialisation. The products from the microreactor with or without cold trap section were respectively collected to compare quantitatively the conversion of the iso-octanol under same reaction conditions, as shown in Table 2. It was shown that the conversion of the iso-octanol in the microreactor without cold trap section was higher than with cold trap section due to the longer reaction time, indicating the tube connected to the output or the long channels of the microreactor were in favor of enhancing the conversion of the iso-octanol. In fact, it is observed that the reaction is still mainly accomplished in the microreactor system, ensuring the safety of reaction process and the purity of product. It can be seen that the conversion reached 98.2% in the microreactor without cold crap when the reaction temperature was 35°C, the residence time was 7.2 s, and the HNO3/C8H17OH mole ratio was 1.5. So the nitration of iso-octanol can be carried out in the microreactor efficiently and safely.

Abstract In this paper, the nitration characteristic of alcohols with mixed acid for the synthesis of energetic mate- rials in a stainless steel microreactor was investigated experimentally. The nitration of iso-octanol with HNO3-H2SO4 mixed acid was chosen as a typical model reaction which involved fast and strong exothermic liquid-liquid heterogeneous reaction process. The influences of mixed acid composition, flow rate, organic/aqueous flow ratio and reaction temperature have been investigated. The results indicated that the reaction could be con- ducted safely and stably in the microreactor at 25�40°C, which are enhanced compared to 15°C or below for safe operating conditions in the conventional reactors. Moreover, the 98.2% conversion of iso-octanol could be obtained and no by-products were detected in all cases. Keywords nitration, 2-ethylhexyl nitrate, microchannel, micromixer, microfluidic

The main objective of this paper is to demon- strate the feasibility and safety of the 2-ethylhexyl nitrate synthesis in the microreactor system, which is proposed to carried out fast exothermic liquid-liquid reaction for energetic material synthesis. The nitration of iso-octanol with mixed acid exhibits the typical features of the fast highly exothermic reaction, even potentially explosion or side reactions associated. The characteristics of the nitration process were investigated by studying the effect of mixed acid composition and operating conditions on the conver- sion of iso-octanol and the average reaction rate. The results showed that the reaction could be almost com- pleted in the microreactor system under some particu- lar reaction conditions. Also, the reaction could be conducted safely and stably in the microreactor at 25�40°C, which are enhanced compared to 15°C or below for safe operating conditions in the conven- tional reactors. Moreover, no by-product was formed and 98.2% of the conversion of iso-octanol could be obtained. Microreactors with enhanced heat and mass transfer combined with small internal channel dimen- sions offer an excellent tool to reduce overall effort to commercial processes for fast exothermic liquid-liquid heterogeneous phase reaction. Based on the advanta- geous mentioned above, it can be accepted that the microreactor is one of the most suitable research and industrial instruments for fast exothermic liquid-liquid reaction.

reactor, respectively. The flow rate and composition of mixed acid were regulated to optimize the operating conditions. Short Teflon tubes with an inner diameter of 3 mm were used to connect all modules. Following the reaction section, there was a cold trap in which the reacting liquid-liquid mixtures were rapidly diluted and cooled to 0°C with ice-water mixture to terminate the reaction instantaneously. Moreover, organic aqueous two phases were separated quickly. The or- ganic phase was washed by water and Na2CO3 (AR, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) solution up to neutralization. The composition of organic phase was identified and quantified by gas chromatograph (GC) with nitrogen as the carrier gas, and a flame ionization detector (FID), an OV-101 capillary column (0.25 �m film thickness, 0.25×50 m) were used. An internal standardization method was used following the procedure given by Grob [17]. Fig. 3 showed the graph of the gas chromatograph. The concentration of the unreacted iso-octanol was calculated from the concentration of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate since no other products or by-products were found to be formed in this process as shown in Fig. 3. The conversion of iso-octanol was calculated as the following equation.

The structure of the stainless steel microreactors used in this experiment is shown in Fig. 1. Etched plate had the same inlet configuration on both sides between point 1/point 2 and point 3 [see Fig. 1 (b)]. Parent channel was divided equally into two arc shaped sub-channels stage by stage until 16 parallel channels were generated. Organic compound and mixed acid were fed at point 1 and point 2, respec- tively. The two flows passed through each inlet zone independently and converged at orifices (point 3) on one side of microreactor plate. Reactants mixed and reacted along the microchannels between point 3 and point 4 with the dimension of every microchannel of 0.5 mm×0.5 mm×78 mm. In this reaction process, the total microreactor system was heated by electric heating method. The mixture of reaction product ef- fused the microreactor at point 4.

(3) Considering the advantages of the microreactor, the direct nitration of iso-octanol with mixed acid was conducted at or above room temperature (25°C) in our study to investigate the potential of the microreactor from both process efficiency and safety point of view.

To ensure the safety of the nitration process of iso-octanol, the reaction temperature is usually main- tained below 15°C in common commercial process [26]. In this part, the experiment was carried out in typically fast reaction regime with the mass composi- tion of 74% H2SO4 and 24% HNO3, and the microre- actor temperatures were varied from 25°C to 40°C as shown in Fig. 8. It was observed that the conversion of iso-octanol increased with the reaction temperature due to the increase of the generation rate of nitronium ion. Moreover, the overall nitration reaction process performed safely and stably, and no other by-products were found, whereas oxidation occurred even at lower temperature in the conventional reactor. The faster heat transfer rate coupled with smaller internal reac- tion volumes of the microreactor increased the ability of temperature control, which not only ensured the safety at higher temperatures, but also prevented tem- perature-induced side reactions and thermal decompo- sition of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate. Ultimately, the selectiv- ity and the purity were increased compared to the cor-

The effect of HNO3/C8H17OH on the conversion of iso-octanol is shown in Fig. 9. As expected, the conversion of iso-octanol within the same residence time was increased with HNO3/C8H17OH mole ratio as the proportion of NO� available was enhanced. Fur- thermore, no other products were observed with the higher HNO3/C8H17OH mole ratio. The efficient mass transfer performance allowed to the suppression of concentration gradients which generated the side reac- tion such as further nitration and oxidation caused by nitric acid.

Zaldivar et al. [18, 19] has indicated that the nitra- tion of aromatics falls into the fast reaction regime at H2SO4 strengths of 70%�80% (by mass) in mixed acid. However, the H2SO4 strengths of mixed acid are larger than 80% (by mass) in our experiments. In addition, alcohols are more easily nitrated by mixed acid under the same conditions compared to the aromatics. Thus, in the iso-octanol nitration liquid-liquid heterogeneous process with HNO3-H2SO4 mixed acid, the reaction rate can be calculated by an interfacial nitration model aimed at fast reaction regimes, and the average reac- tion rate is adopted in this paper. This model assumes that organic nitration occurs in the aqueous phase close to the interface and is controlled by mass trans- fer of organic phase across the interface of liquid-liquid two phases, and the reaction occurs within the mixed acid phase. The average reaction rate based on the volume of the microreactor can be written as:

magnitude higher than those in traditional liquid-liquid large scaled contactors [25]. The interfacial area be- tween two immiscible fluids stretches, deforms, and folds with the increase of LHSV, as well as the surface renewal velocity is enhanced, making the interphase mass transfer more effective, which significantly in- tensifies mass transfer process and increases the over- all volumetric mean mass transfer coefficient. There- fore, the average reaction rate increased with the ve- locity in the mass transfer controlled systems. Obvi- ously, this effect on the mass transfer was relatively severe in the mixed acid system with higher sulfuric acid strength. Moreover, when LHSV was high enough, the reaction would be controlled by kinetics rather than mass transfer, so average reaction rate achieved limit value as shown in Fig. 6. In fact, the higher iso-octanol conversion could be obtained with lower LHSV in these reaction systems due to the longer residence time in the microreactor.

To study the influence of sulfuric acid concentra- tion, the nitration process of iso-octanol was investi- gated at room temperature with 2% and 15% H2O (by mass) in the mixed acid, respectively. In this part, the mole ratio of nitric acid to iso-octanol and LHSV were fixed to 1.0 and 1000 h �1, respectively. The experi- mental results in Fig. 4 show that the conversion of iso-octanol gradually increased with sulfuric acid concentration in the mixed acid for 15% H2O (by mass) within the same residence time. However, this effect was reduced when the content of water decreases to 2% (by mass) especially for the sulfuric acid con- centration in the range of 67% to 86% (by mass).

sulfuric acid strength before and after reaction. The sulfuric acid strength after reaction was still higher for the mixed acid with 2% H2O (by mass), even higher than the initiative sulfuric acid strength for the mixed acid with 15% H2O (by mass), leading to the higher conversion.

In the nitration of iso-octanol with mixed acid, chemical reaction and mass transfer are simultane- ously carried out and both affected by the mixed acid composition. In order to investigate the nitration process of iso-octanol in the microreactor, a series of experiments were performed with different operating conditions.

In order to investigate the effect of LHSV on the nitration process of iso-octanol, the experiments were carried out using two kinds of typical mixed acid composition at room temperature. Their mass compo- sition was 58% H2SO4 and 26% HNO3, and 74% H2SO4 and 24% HNO3, respectively. The average re- action rate is plotted against LHSV in Figs. 6 and 7. It could be seen that the average reaction rate was di- rectly proportional to LHSV for both reaction systems, implicating these nitration processes were still limited by mass transfer in the microreactor. In fact, the effect of LHSV was more remarkable in the mixed acid with higher sulfuric acid strength because the reaction rate was faster and the nitration process was more greatly limited by mass transfer performance of liquid-liquid immiscible two phases. According to our previous research [24], the flow regimes selected for the present investigation are mainly the parallel flow with smooth interface, the parallel flow with wavy interface, and even the chaotic thin striations flow in this microreac- tor. The hydrodynamic characteristics of mass transfer in these flow regimes have been systematically inves- tigated. The overall volumetric mass transfer coeffi- cients obtained are more than two or three orders of
