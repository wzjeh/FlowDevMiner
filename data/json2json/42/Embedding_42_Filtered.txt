The reactions were conducted at constant flow rate of the reac- tants V*(CO2) = 200 �L/min, V*(C6H10) = 23 �L/min both at 136 bar and 18 ◦C (pump feed conditions) and V*(H2) = 5.6 sccm. This corre- sponds to a molar ratio of 90:5:5. To demonstrate the influence of operating conditions on the reaction performance temperature and pressure in the microreactor were varied in the range of T = 40–70 ◦C and p = 80–150 bar, respectively. At constant pressure of 136 bar it can be stated from the optical analysis that the reaction mixture is present in a single phase for the observed temperature range. The pressure variation was performed at 50 ◦C and pressures ranging from 80 to 150 bar. For pressures higher than 100 bar a single phase is present. At 80 bar a two phase flow of H2 and scCO2/C6H10 was observed. The mean residence time through the packed bed with a measured porosity of 0.688 was calculated in the range of tmean = 0.17–0.5 s depending on the temperature. Isothermal con- ditions of the microreactor were assumed because of the low Biot number in the order of Bi = 1 × 10−3, where Bi is defined as Lch/�. Lc is the characteristic length of the microreactor, h is the heat trans- fer coefficient from the microreactor to the environment and � is the thermal conductivity of the microreactor material. Conversions observed were between 20 and 93%, depending on the catalyst load- ing and operating conditions. The performance of the microreactor is expressed by the converted moles of C6H10 per time per mass of catalyst (Fig. 9). In Fig. 9 the influence of temperature on the reaction rate is shown. An increase in reaction rate with increasing temper- ature is obvious due to Arrhenius law. The reaction mixture is in single phase for all experiments, even at subcritical tempera- tures of CO2 as seen in the phase study. At isobaric conditions density, dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity of the reac- tion solvent CO2 decrease with increasing temperature, which leads to different observations. The kinematic viscosity, which has a big influence on mass transfer, changes only little in the range from 7.4 × 10−8 to 8.5 × 10−8 m2/s. A decrease in thermal conductivity decreases the heat removal from the exother- mic reaction. The maximum heat produced by the reaction is Q* = 3.84 × 10−6 mol/s × −118 kJ/mol = −0.45 W. In an earlier exper- iment a lumped heat transfer coefficient from the microreactor surface to the environment of about h = 25 W/m2 K was mea- sured. The heat loss at the surface dominates therefore the heat generation of the reaction above a temperature difference of 13 K.

A versatile high pressure experimental setup for continuous operation as shown in Fig. 3 is used for the experiments. The setup allows the individual adjustment of the liquid and gas flow rates and of the system pressure. Stainless steel and polyetheretherke- tone (PEEK) capillaries (o.d. = 1.56 mm, i.d. = 0.5 mm) were used as tubing. High pressure PEEK connections (Upchurch Scientific) pro- vide a leak tight connection of the microreactor to the setup. C02 and C6H10 are fed in liquid phase by two water cooled high pressure syringe pumps (260D, ISCO). Hydrogen flow is controlled by a high pressure mass flow controller (F-230M, Bronkhorst). The pressure in the microreactor is controlled by an automated needle valve back pressure regulator (BP-1580-81, Jasco). The microreactor is placed in an oil bath for reactions at elevated temperatures. Standard reaction conditions were 136 bar and 70 ◦C with flow rates of the reactants of V*(CO2) = 200 �L/min (136 bar, 18 ◦C), V*(C6H10) = 23 �L/min (136 bar, 18 ◦C) and V*(H2) = 5.6 sccm. The ratio of the flow rates corresponds to a molar ratio of CO2:C6H10:H2 = 90:5:5. The reaction performance is analyzed within temperature and pressure ranges from 40 to 70 ◦C and 80–150 bar respectively. For phase studies the C6H10:H2 molar ratio is changed from 1:1 up to 1:4 to show the increase of hydrogen solu- bility in scCO2. Samples are collected in a sample vial after the back pressure regulator. The vial is cooled in an ice water bath and the product is diluted in toluene to dissolve the product for GC analy- sis. The conversion is analyzed offline by GC–MS. The three highest conversion values at steady state conditions are averaged to calcu- late the maximum reaction rates. No side products are detected by GC–MS. The cyclohexene conversion is calculated from the chro- matograms, where linearity between peak area and concentration is checked in the range of used conditions.

studied. All reactants are brought in contact, mix and react on the chip. In situ phase studies of the reaction mixture and the reac- tion performance were discussed. The phase studies confirmed a single phase reaction mixture at 25 and 50 ◦C during isobaric reaction conditions of 136 bar. The reaction performance increased with temperature whereas with increasing pressure no significant increase was observed. A comparison of the reactor performance in terms of space time yield with different reactor systems for the same model reaction is presented. The results indicate that high pressure microreactors are favorable for exothermic reactions because of the good heat removal due to the small reactor length scales. The space time yield is one order of magnitude greater than earlier reported values. Nevertheless, the translation to commercial scale throughput in microreactors still needs further investigations. Especially, the manifold design hence the equal distribution of fluid into numerous parallel microchannels must be addressed. This study shows the feasibility of high pressure Si/glass microreactors for reactions using scCO2 as the reaction solvent. The concept of an integrated high pressure microreactor chip is used for future in situ spectroscopic measurements. Further stud- ies will investigate in situ spectroscopic analysis methods as UV/Vis and Raman which will provide deeper insights in high pressure heterogeneous reactions involving supercritical fluids.

The efficiency of the presented microreactor in terms of reac- tion performance is compared to other packed bed reactors at the �Land mL-scale. As a measure we compare the space time yield (kgproduct/hm3 catalyst) for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene in the case of a three phase reaction and with scCO2 as the reac- tion solvent. The increase of efficiency in different reactor systems is manifold. Applying high pressure increases the performance because it increases the hydrogen solubility. Using scCO2 as reac- tion solvent also enhanced productivity since the mass transfer resistance from the gas to the liquid phase vanishes in single phase flow. The single phase behavior of the reaction mixture, confirmed by optical measurements, avoids the gas/liquid mass transfer resis- tance. The concentration of the hydrogen within the single phase is controlled by the flow rate applied not by the solubility of hydrogen within the reaction media since H2 and CO2 are fully miscible. The efficiency of the microreactor system is further increased by a good heat removal from the catalyst due to the higher heat capacity of the dense gas and the good thermal conductivity of silicon (150 W/m K). Table 2 lists space time yields for different systems found in liter- ature. In case of a three phase reaction the influence of pressure leads to an increase of efficiency of one order of magnitude. The high pressure three phase microreactor has a performance in the same range than the 5 mL reactor at supercritical conditions. The large surface-to-volume ratio of the microreactor combined with the good thermal conductivity of Si leads to an increased heat removal from the exothermic reaction. The present study increases the efficiency by another order of magnitude compared to the larger reactor at supercritical conditions. This is attributed to the better heat removal, which can be realized in microreactors avoiding hot spots in the packed bed. For the identification of possible external mass transfer limita- tion at the liquid–solid interface a quantitative analysis is difficult to conduct due to the lack of correlations to estimate the mass transfer coefficient in a microscale packed bed. Concerning the pore diffusion limitation the Weisz criterion [18] gives an indication of the limiting step. The analysis was performed for the experiments where the conversion was around 20%, at p = 136 bar and T = 40 ◦C. In this case, we assume a differential reactor. The bulk concentra- tion of hydrogen is assumed to be the concentration at the surface of the particles. The molecular diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in scCO2 is estimated at 1 × 10−8 m2/s. This is the order of magnitude reported in different papers. This value is for sure underestimated, in experiments carried out by Ludemann and Chen [19] reported this value for T = 253 K and p = 1000 bar. Thus the Weisz criterion, at our reaction conditions, is below 0.1. This means that the internal mass transfer does not limit the reaction.

The Si/glass microreactors are fabricated using standard pho- tolithography, dry etching and anodic bonding techniques. The high pressure microfluidic connections are realized by soldering stain- less steel capillaries directly onto the chip similar to the technique used in [14]. The detailed fabrication process and the high pressure testing of the chip are reported elsewhere [10]. The rectangular channel dimensions in the main section were 400 �m in width and 300 �m in depth respectively (dh = 343 �m). These dimensions were chosen for a practicable handling of the particles and flow rates and the mechanical stability of the device. Furthermore the channel length provides the fluid to heat up to the set tempera- ture for isothermal reaction conditions. The microreactor design as

flow is observed. The reaction mixture enters the reaction zone as a single phase at 136 bar and 50 ◦C for high hydrogen content such as 9.8 mol%. In Fig. 8, regard to the position (6) at the reactors outlet only at 24 ◦C and a ratio of 1:4 H2 bubbles are observed. In all other cases the hydrogen was entirely dissolved in the reaction mixture. The two effects of an enhanced mixing in the packed bed and the hydrogen consumption increase the homogeneity of the reaction mixture. At 24 ◦C only at high H2 content the mixture was not present in one single phase. This is due to the limited solubility of H2 in the mixture but also due to the short residence time in the reactor. At 50 ◦C no H2 bubbles can be detected at the entrance to the packed bed within the number of recorded images. This leads to the conclusion that the reactants are present in one sin- gle phase. At the outlet the reaction mixture contains CO2, C6H10, C6H12 and H2 which is a quaternary mixture, but the critical points of C6H10 (Tc = 287.3 ◦C) and C6H12 (Tc = 280.3 ◦C) are relatively close together that the system can be considered as ternary mixture, which was modeled by Hitzler et al. [12] using Peng-Robinson equation of state. A single phase behavior of a 90:5:5 mixture at 120 bar and 50 ◦C can be derived from their results. Arunajatesan et al. [13] conducted phase studies in a high pressure view cell and suggested a homogeneous phase of a 30% converted reaction mix- ture at about 115 bar and 70 ◦C. In our experiments it is seen that high hydrogen contents can be dissolved in the reaction mixture using scCO2 as the reaction solvent. This is not possible in case of a reaction mixture containing only C6H10 and H2. Using an esti- mated Henry constant of H = 2648.5 bar (T = 50 ◦C, p = 136 bar) [17] H2 would be soluble in C6H10 in the extent of x = 0.05 mol H2/mol

The advantage of high pressure microreactors compared to their macroscale counterparts is obvious. No excessive wall thick- ness of the reaction channel is needed for mechanical stability and the impact of hazardous failure is drastically reduced since only little quantities of material are involved. Until now only few studies discuss high pressure chemical reactions in continuous flow microreactors. The equipment such as precision high pres- sure pumps and back pressure regulators lead to high investment cost furthermore high pressure microfluidic connections are not yet standardized for chip-based microreactors. Mechanically stable microfluidic connections for high pressure and high temperature are still difficult to manufacture if different materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion are involved. Most high pressure reactions in continuous flow microreac- tors are conducted in capillaries. This has several advantages such as the use of standard high pressure fluidic connections, inex- pensive tubing and an adjustable reactor volume by the length of the capillary. The main drawback is the lack of optical trans-

shown in Fig. 2 consists of three inlets for the reactants, a meander- ing mixing section, a packed bed and a common outlet. The inlets were designed to primarily generate a stable segmented gas–liquid flow of C6H10 and H2, which is then dissolved by a side inflow of scCO2. The 64.6 mm long mixing section provides the reactants to mix and generate a single phase reaction mixture. The meandering shape of the channel enhances mass transfer in the radial direction, when hydrogen bubbles are present [15]. The catalyst particles were inserted via a side channel into the microreactor forming a packed bed of a maximum length of 26.5 mm. Micromachined sieves at the entrance and exit of the packed bed define the length of the packed bed as described in [16].

High pressure is used to enhance the reaction rate in chemical reactions. This is due to the thermodynamic pressure effect and in case of hydrogenations the increased solubility of hydrogen. The use of supercritical fluids in chemical reactions influences a variety of fluid characteristics which are beneficial for chemical reactions such as increased solubility, higher diffusivities than in liquids and the ease of product separation after the reaction to mention a few [11]. For our study the hydrogenation of cyclohexene using scCO2 (Tc = 31 ◦C, pc = 74 bar) as the reaction solvent as shown in Fig. 1 is used as a model reaction. Hydrogenations belong to a reaction class of major importance since it is used in numerous synthesis pathways of common prod- ucts and pharmaceuticals. Mass transfer limitations are often seen in these processes, which make them favorable to study at high pressure and with supercritical fluids (SCFs) as reaction solvents to overcome these limitations. Hitzler et al. [12] conducted the hydro- genation of cyclohexene in scCO2 at pressures of 120–140 bar and catalyst bed temperature up to 340 ◦C in a 5 and 10 mL tube reac- tor. High conversion up to 99.8% is reported. Arunajatesan et al. [13] performed the same reaction at 136 bar and 70 ◦C in a 2.8 mL fixed

bed reactor. They measured a conversion of 80% and an effective heat dissipation by the supercritical reactions mixture. Hot spots during the exothermic hydrogenation of cyclohexene in the packed bed were prevented. In this study we focus on the reaction performance in a packed bed Si/glass microreactor using scCO2 as the reaction solvent. Mixing of the reactants is realized on chip. The supercritical reac- tion mixture is observed by in situ phase studies. The observation of phase behavior for supercritical reaction studies is crucial. A change from a multiphase system to a single phase has signif- icant influence on the heat and mass transfer behavior of the reaction. Therefore insight in the phase behavior of the reaction mixture at the operating conditions is needed to draw conclu- sions of the reaction performance. Since the presented Si/glass microreactor is optically accessible through the glass side, the phase studies can be conducted in situ. We decided for a Si/glass microreactor chip because of its advantages over capillary and glass chip-based designs. Microfabrication allows us to gener- ate precise flow distribution and mixing features in the range of tens of �m. This is not possible in capillary reactors. Silicon as a reactor material provides high mechanical strength, chemical inertness and a high thermal conductivity providing a uniform temperature distribution on the chip. The optical access through the glass into the reaction channel is crucial for phase and flow studies.

parency in metallic tubes and that the integration of different units such as mixing, heating and analysis is difficult to realize within one single capillary. A quartz capillary reactor is designed and used for oxidation studies in supercritical water by Maharrey and Miller [1]. The same authors performed online mass spectroscopy at the reactors outlet, designed as a nozzle [2]. A supercritical water microreaction setup made from Hastelloy capillaries is pre- sented by Ikushima et al. [3]. A Silica fiber as microreactor is presented by Benito-Lopez et al. [4], where optical fibers are inte- grated via a cross-connection for UV/Vis monitoring of the reaction. A "step-by-step-rapid-mixing and heating" microfluidic system of Hastelloy capillaries for reactions in high pressure and high tem- perature water is designed by Kawanami et al. [5]. In conclusion the capillary-based microreactor studies point out the inexpensive capillaries, the rapid heating and quenching, the ease of han- dling high pressures and the low energy consumption compared to macroscale high pressure setups. Chip-based microreactors follow the concept of the full integra- tion of different units in one single chip. Precise micromachining possibilities enable the fabrication of �m-range features that is necessary for the design of passive mixing elements and flow con- trol such as bubble formation. Glass or Si/glass as reactor material allows the optical access into the microfluidic reaction channel and is hereby advantageous. The more expensive fabrication com- pared to capillary reactors and the not standardized microfluidic connections may be accounted as drawbacks. Planar chip-type high pressure microreactors are rarely reported in literature. A

feed and the microchannel design. For all analyzed conditions a general behavior can be observed. At measurement position (1) (see Fig. 4(b)) a segmented gas–liquid flow of H2 and liquid C6H10 is seen. The gas introduction via a narrow side channel provides a stable for- mation of gas bubbles and liquid slugs. The gas bubbles reduce and increase size in the subsequent section with the broadening and reducing channel width. At position (2) dense CO2 is introduced from the side into the segmented gas–liquid flow. The superfi- cial velocities of the merging stream at the CO2 inlet (p = 136 bar, T = 24 ◦C, 90:5:5) are v(C6H10) = 0.0053 m/s, v(H2) = 0.0096 m/s and v(CO2) = 0.088 m/s. These large velocity gradients between CO2 and the passing flow of hydrogen and C6H10 lead to a break up of the well defined segmented flow pattern and a chaotic mix- ing of the compounds. H2 bubbles and C6H10 slugs are split into small fractions and the reactants start to solubilize in CO2. Posi- tion (3) defines the beginning of the meandering mixing section. It is located 6.6 mm (=26x/dh) downstream the CO2 inlet. A bub- bly flow of H2 in a liquid mixture of CO2 and C6H10 is observed. In the meandering mixing section (4) the hydrogen continuously diffuses into the reaction mixture which itself is further mixed. At the entrance of the packed bed (5) the fluid passes the sieve with channel widths of 50 �m. Due to the reaction in the packed bed the concentrations in the mixture change and at the outlet (6) it has a different composition. As hydrogen is used during reaction the mis- cibility of the reaction mixture is increased, since lower hydrogen content increases the miscibility of the ternary reaction mixture [12]. In Fig. 5 the influence on temperature and C6H10:H2 ratio on the phase behavior at different channel locations is seen. The pres- sure is fixed at p = 136 bar. Temperatures were 24 and 50 ◦C. The substrate to hydrogen molar ratios were 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4, where the mass flow rate of CO2 was set constant at 200 �L/min (136 bar, 18 ◦C). From theses pictures a qualitative analysis of the phase behavior is described for the different locations.

In Fig. 5 a stable segmented gas–liquid flow is observed at posi- tion (1). The influence of temperature on segmented gas–liquid flow is manly reflected in the decreasing slug length of C6H10 and increasing bubble length of H2 at constant C6H10:H2 ratio. With decreasing C6H10:H2 ratio the bubble length increases exceeding the FOV of the measurement section due to the higher gas flow rate of hydrogen. At position (2) the break up of the segmented flow by CO2 is difficult to characterize (Fig. 5). The CO2 changes from liquid to supercritical state from 24 to 50 ◦C. In terms of flow pattern no significant change with temperature can be seen. By decreasing the C6H10:H2 ratio coalesced hydrogen bubbles appear again ear- lier after the injection of CO2. Fig. 6 shows in more detail how the two phase flow of H2 and C6H10 breaks up by the scCO2 side inlet. As before the CO2 inlet H2 bubbles are seen, all H2 is dissolved afterwards at the corresponding operating conditions. In Fig. 7 hydrogen bubble coalescence appears in downstream position (3) of CO2 injection. At 24 ◦C coalesced bubbles occur and form a bubbly flow pattern. A change from 24 to 50 ◦C results in the total solution of hydrogen in the reaction mixture. With increasing hydrogen content more and larger bubbles are present at 24 ◦C. At 50 ◦C for all C6H10:H2 ratios a single phase flow is observed. At the position (4) the dissolving of H2 in the reaction mixture proceeds (Fig. 7). Disappeared bubbles or decreased bubble sizes are observed at 24 ◦C compared to position (3). With decreasing C6H10:H2 ratio more and larger bubbles are present. At 50 ◦C single phase flow is observed. In Fig. 8 at the inlet to the packed bed, position (5), most hydro- gen has been dissolved at 24 ◦C. At 1:2 and 1:4 small bubbles are visible. At 50 ◦C no change on the previously detected single phase
