# Influence Factor Analysis

| Factor | Metric | Direction |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| temperature | conversion of Safranin O | increase |
| temperature | conversion of Safranin O | unchanged |
| reactor_length | conversion of Safranin O | increase |
| temperature | effect of reactor length | increase |
| flow_rate of dye | removal efficiency | decrease |
| flow_rate of persulfate | conversion of Safranin O | increase |
| temperature | effect of persulfate flow rate | - |
| temperature (low: 30–40 °C) | conversion of Safranin O | increase |
| Fe2+ concentration | conversion of Safranin O | increase |
| temperature (60–80 °C) | conversion of Safranin O | - |
| Fe2+ concentration (high: 0.1–0.2 mM) | conversion of Safranin O | decrease |
| water_matrix (river, secondary effluent, seawater) | conversion of Safranin O | decrease |
| temperature (70–80 °C) | effect of water matrix | unchanged |
| activation_type (thermo-catalytic) | TOC reduction | increase |
