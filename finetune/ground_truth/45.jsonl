It can be seen in Fig. 11a, the highest Tr was always detected by T1 which indicated the reaction was the most violent inside the first two reaction modules. With higher flow rates, the detected overtemperature phenomenon (Tr − Tr,0) was getting increasingly significant and it reached up to 21.3 ∘C for the flow rate of 60 mL/min. Fig. 11b shows the pressure under different flow rates. The outlet of the module was connected to atmosphere. With the increasing of flow velocity, more reaction modules were adopted to keep the residence time identical. The longer reaction channel together with higher velocity caused the increase of inlet pressure. Besides, it can be seen the pressure de- creased approximately linearly along the channel. A single reaction module was used for the flow rate of 10 mL/min and very few exothermicity was observed at the outlet. It can be inferred that the exothermicity entirely occurred inside the module. An analysis of temperature variation inside the channel is made based on the reaction process and experimental data, shown in Fig. 12. Reactants were pre-heated to Ti and the reaction began when the two streams of fluids collided at the Y-junction. The concentra- tions of reactants were high at the beginning, leading to fast reaction rate and high heat generation rate. Besides, the oil in the jacket acted as a heating source at this stage. As a result, Tr increased dramatically at the beginning. When Tr exceeded Tr,0, the oil transferred to a cooling source and the heat removal rate gradually increased with the increasing temperature difference between the fluids inside the channel and the oil, according to Eq. 16. Additionally, reaction rate slowed down due to the generation of water and decrease of re- actants concentration. However, heat generation rate was still higher than heat removal rate at this stage. Thus, Tr rose at a gradually slowing rate. When the rate of heat generation equalled to heat removal, Tr reached the highest, namely Tmax. Thereafter, as reactants continue to flow, Tr gradually got closer to Tr,0. Furthermore, the temperature of T1 was assumed between Tc and Tmax (Fig. 12a, area\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The semi batch reaction process in RC1 showed a highest value of over- temperature of 24.6∘C and the MNT selectivity of 62%. The heat and mass transfer efficiency was low in the batch reactor. A meso-scale reactor system was adopted to scale up toluene nitration in a flow way. Parallel flow regime was observed in the channel and Bo was bigger than 1, indicating the effect of gravity can not be ignored. CFD simulation demonstrated the hydrodynamic characteristics of the two reactants flowing inside the Y-mixer. Overall mass transfer coefficient was determined by n-butanol-succinic acid-water system. With the increasing of Re, ka increased linearly which was in the range of 0.01 ~ 0.07 s−1. Volumetric flow rate had a significant influence on toluene nitration. Experimental results showed that toluene conversion increased from 26% to 86% while MNT selectivity increased from 73% to 95% with the increasing of flow rates from 10 mL/min to 60 mL/min. However, reaction temperatures and molar ratios had no significant impact on toluene conversion. Meanwhile, increasing the reaction temperature would lower the MNT se- lectivity. A comparison between semi-batch and continuous reaction modes was also presented. It showed that overtemperature phe- nomenon was still remarkable in the flow reactor, which meant the present heat removal capacity was far from enough. By adopting flow reaction mode, the reaction environment was converted from an open system to a pressurized system, which can be deemed as risk transfer.The productivity of the flow reactor could reach up to 2572 kg/a, which was much higher than the bench-scale batch re- actor. In this study, it can be seen that the decrease of heat and mass transfer efficiency is inevitable in direct dimension-enlarge of channels. In this 1/4 in. meso-scale flow reactor, overtemperature phenomenon was notable. It will not only lead to side reactions, but also cause potential hazards. It must be stressed that safety in scale up process of microreactors should not be ignored. A systematic evaluation method to assess the safety level of flow reactors may be developed, which is seldom reported at present.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Effect of molar ratio The effect of molar ratios on toluene nitration was investigated. The Tr,0 was set at 45 ∘C and the volumetric flow rate was 30 mL/min. Seven reaction modules were adopted. The experimental results are summarized in Fig. 16 and Table 5. Tr along the reactor was not shown here as it was same for these three conditions. The viscosity of toluene and the mixed acid were 0.59 mPa ⋅ s and 4.70 mPa ⋅ s (20 ∘C), respectively. Therefore, there was a slight increase of pres- sure with the rise of molar ratio. By raising the ratio of mixed acid, the conversion increased from 61% to 73% and meanwhile the se- lectivity stayed unchanged. As this is a mass-transfer controlled re- action, dinitration may happen under high concentration of nitric acid. However, dinitration required a high temperature. Owing to the high heat removal efficiency of this meso-scale flow reactor, the value of overtemperature was not too high and the time of over- temperature was short. Consequently, the selectivity did not drop with the increasing of molar ratio.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Even if excluded the holding time, it was as long as 3000 s. As a contrast, in the meso-scale flow reactor, this time could be shortened to 132 s to achieve similar conversion and better selectivity. Hence, the space time yield as well as the annual production of the flow reactor was much higher than the batch re- actor. Although the highest value of overtemperature was similar in the two reactors, its duration time was much shorter in the flow system. But meanwhile, this indicated a more dramatic temperature change inside the flow reactor, which may put forward extra re- quirement on the reactor material. Further, by employing flow mode, the reaction environment was converted from an open system to a pressurized system. Due to the long and narrow channel, the inlet pressure could be as high as 1.1 MPa. Therefore, sealing was more demanding in the flow reactor to avoid rupture and leakage. This could be deemed as a kind of risk transfer in flow mode (Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover, the total inventory of reactants in the flow reactor was one order of magnitude smaller than that in the batch reactor. This was the crucial point making flow reactor inherently safer.

Thermocouples and pressure transmitters were used to measure temperature and pres- sure inside the reaction channel while valves were installed for easy sampling. During the experiments, nitration samples were collected directly at the outlet and quenched immediately by ice water only when the system was stable. In general, there is a temperature difference between reactants inside the channel and the oil in the jacket due to insufficient heat transfer. Thereto, the setting point of the thermostat (Tset) can not represent the reaction temperature. To carry out toluene nitration under different reaction temperatures, a pre-test was conducted to determine the corresponding setting temperatures. The volumetric flow rate ratio of mixed acid to toluene exceeded 3, hence the mixed acid was adopted as the medium solely in this test to avoid the in- fluence of reaction heat. A part of the testing result is shown in Table 3. For instance, if the volumetric flow rate of reactants inside the channel (Q) was 30 mL/min and the reactants did not release heat, Tset was 55 ∘C, then Tr would be 45 ∘C. This Tr was recorded as Tr,0, which was referred to reaction temperature in this study. The overall heat transfer process between the oil in the jacket and the reactants inside the channel includes three procedures.

For a batch reaction, T and [X] change with the reaction process or time. And at a specific time node, there is always a corresponding reaction rate. Therefore, for this batch reaction process, reaction rate can be expressed as a function of time (t), namely r = f(t). However, in the flow reactor, T and [X] vary along the reactor channel which means they are de- pendent on the location. Hence, the reaction rate in the flow reactor can be expressed as a function of the length from inlet (z), namely r = f(z). By transferring the reaction process from batch to flow, the reaction rate is transferred from a time variable to a space variable as well (Morin et al., 2021). Obviously, it is much easier to handle a space variable. For example, to prevent thermal runaway and reduce side reactions of toluene nitration, the heat removal efficiency at the beginning should be the largest. In the flow reactor, this can easily be achieved by using a cooler heat transfer medium solely for channel with a certain length after the inlet and the rest channel will not be affected. While in the batch reactor, this is more difficult to be achieved, especially in industry. Therefore, compared to batch re- actors, flow reactors are safer and more efficient. Further, by comparing the products from these two reaction modes, it is found that there are two approaches to improve the selectivity of MNT. One is to enhance the heat removal capacity and carry out the reaction under a suitable and stable temperature. Dinitration can not happen under low temperature. The other way is to increase mass transfer efficiency. This is because when the reac- tion condition of mononitration and dinitration are reached si- multaneously, mononitration happens first if there are enough toluene dissolved in the acid phase.

Microstructured systems efficiently utilize advantages re- sulting from small scale. In comparison to conventional reactors, one of the main features of microreactors is the high surface-to-volume ratio (Kulkarni et al., 2009; Cherkasov et al., 2016). Their specific surface areas can reach up to 50000 m2∕m3, which is two or three orders of magnitude higher than conventional reactors (Jähnisch et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2019). Owing to this, heat transfer rate of microstructures is significantly improved and reactions can be car- ried out under nearly isothermal conditions with exactly defined residence times. On account of the high heat removal efficiency and continuous operation mode, local hot spots which serve as ignitions for explosions are minimized (Newman and Jensen, 2013; Kockmann et al., 2017). On the other hand, as the dimensions of micro- structured reactors are extremely small, the total inventory of ha- zardous reactants in the reactors is quite little. The power of an explosion is proportional to the mass of explosives, thus the severity of a potential explosion in microstructures is low (Anon, 2016; Kockmann et al., 2017). Further, mixing time in microreactors can be shortened to several milliseconds due to the small dimensions of pathways. Therefore, microreactors are quite suitable for inherently safer re-design of fast and highly exothermic reactions (Hartman et al., 2011; Srinivasan and Natarajan, 2012).\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Thus, only one condition was simulated, namely, Q = 60 mL/min and molar ratio (C7H8∕HNO3) was 1:1.2. Fig. 9 shows the potential flow field inside the mixer. In the junction zone, to- luene and mixed acid collided and the velocity reached the max- imum. The sudden enlargement of the channel caused vortexes, which may further enhance mass transfer. In the channel after the junction zone, parallel flow formed and the interface became smooth, which was in agreement with the experiment. At this stage, the flow was stable and the velocity vectors were all in the same direction.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
