For a given nitrobenzene concentration, there exists a ratio of a minimum gas flow rate to theoretical value for enabling the complete nitrobenzene conversion. Therefore, in this study, the nitrobenzene conversions at various conditions (gas flow rate ranging from 0.01 sccm to 0.35 sccm, liquid flow rate ranging from 5 lL/min to 25 lL/min and inlet concentration ranging from 30 mM to 90 mM) were summarized. These conditions corre- sponded to high conversion rate (P97%) with the smallest required gas flow rate.

The theoretical values under these conditions are also shown in Fig. 9a, as indicated by the dash lines.

Liquid flow rate In this experiment, three inlet nitrobenzene concentrations of 30 mM, 60 mM and 90 mM were selected. The gas flow rate was kept at 0.05 sccm, while the liquid flow rate ranged from 5 lL/ min to 25 lL/min. Fig. 8 shows the variations of the aniline concen- tration and nitrobenzene conversion with the liquid flow rate under different inlet concentrations. Obviously, for a given gas flow rate, the aniline concentration (see Fig. 8a) and nitrobenzene con- version (see Fig. 8b) was firstly kept unchanged and then decreased at low nitrobenzene concentration of 30 mM. They were always quickly decreased with increasing the liquid flow rate at high nitrobenzene concentration of 90 mM, while both of them slightly decreased with increasing the liquid flow rate from 5 lL/min and then quickly decreased as the liquid flow rate was further increased at the moderate nitrobenzene concentration of 60 mM. The reasons leading to these phenomena are described as follows. For a given gas flow rate, the supplied nitrobenzene at low liquid flow rates could be fully utilized to generate aniline at low inlet nitrobenzene concentration of 30 mM. As a result, the aniline con- centrations were quite close to the inlet nitrobenzene concentra- tions and the corresponding nitrobenzene conversions were nearly 100%. As the liquid flow rate increased, the supplied hydro- gen might be insufficient, leading to the decrease of the aniline concentration and nitrobenzene conversion. For the moderate inlet nitrobenzene concentration of 60 mM, at low liquid flow rate of 5 lL/min, the supplied hydrogen could meet the complete reaction requirement so that the aniline concentration was close to the inlet nitrobenzene and the nitrobenzene conversion approached to 100%. As the liquid flow rate increased to 10 lL/min, the supplied hydrogen started to become insufficient but could still meet the most requirement for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene.

In this measurement, the gas flow rate was kept at 0.05 sccm and the liquid flow rate was maintained at 5 lL/min. The inlet nitrobenzene ranged from 30 mM to 90 mM. The effluents from the outlet were collected every two hour. Fig. 5a shows the variation of the nitrobenzene conversion under different inlet nitrobenzene concentrations. As shown, over the entire operation period, the average aniline con- centrations at the outlet were 29.36 mM, 58.31 mM and 87.93 mM with respect to the inlet nitrobenzene concentration of 30 mM, 60 mM and 90 mM, respectively. The corresponding aver- age nitrobenzene conversions were 97.4%, 97.2% and 97.5%, as shown in Fig. 5b. Such high nitrobenzene conversions under differ- ent inlet nitrobenzene concentrations can be attributed to enhanced mass transfer in the microreactor and excellent catalytic activity of the prepared catalyst layer, both of which facilitated hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to yield good performance. More- over, it can be seen that the nitrobenzene conversion was rather stable, as shown in Fig. 5a. It is indicated that the catalysts have been strongly adhered to the PDA layer to enhance the operation stability. On the other hand, because of enhanced mass transport, the products including the intermediates can be efficiently removed, avoiding the catalyst poison and thereby further improv- ing the stability. In summary, the microreactor with the coated Pd- PDA layer can yield good and stable performance.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

As a result, more aniline could be produced, resulting in the increase of the aniline concentration. Meanwhile, higher aniline concentration would be achieved with increasing the inlet nitrobenzene concentration under the same gas and liquid flow rates. This is because more nitrobenzene was supplied and larger nitrobenzene concentration created a larger concentration gradi- ent from the bulk to the active surface, enhancing the mass trans- port and thereby producing more aniline. As the gas flow rate was further increased, excess hydrogen was fed into the microreactor to ensure the all supplied nitrobenzene to be involved into the cat- alytic reaction. In this case, the aniline concentration approached to the inlet nitrobenzene concentration. Further increasing the gas flow rate would not change the aniline concentration due to the limited supply of nitrobenzene. Corresponding to the varia- tions of the aniline concentration, the nitrobenzene conversion was also firstly increased at low gas flow rate and then maintained at 97%, (see Fig. 6b). From the above results, it can be found that for a given liquid flow rate, with the increase of the gas flow rate, the catalytic reac- tion experienced two stages: insufficient and excess supply of hydrogen. The change point represented the minimum hydrogen consumption rate, assuming the complete utilization of hydrogen with a 100% conversion of nitrobenzene.

As seen, the excess ratio was gradually decreased with the increase of the liquid flow rate. It is easy to understand that increasing the liquid flow rate resulted in the increase of the supplied nitrobenzene so that more gaseous reac- tant supply of hydrogen is needed. The increased gas flow rate would enhance the mass transport between the phases for both reactants and products, enhancing the utilization of gaseous reac- tant and thereby decreasing the excess ratio. In addition, the excess ratio in the case of low inlet nitrobenzene concentration was larger than that at high concentration. This may be attributed to two rea- sons. On one hand, high inlet nitrobenzene concentration required more gaseous reactant, which accordingly increased the gas flow rate, leading to the enhancement of the mass transfer of hydrogen. On the other hand, high inlet nitrobenzene concentration was ben- eficial for the reaction and formed a relatively high nitrobenzene concentration gradient as compared with low inlet nitrobenzene concentration, which would intensify the mass transport of nitrobenzene. Therefore, the gaseous reactant utilization efficiency under high inlet nitrobenzene concentration was enhanced so that the excess ratio decreased as the inlet nitrobenzene concentration\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Both the surface chemical composition and topog- raphy characterizations indicated that the inner surface of the microreactor was successfully modified with the polydopamine and Pd nanoparticles were well deposited on the modified surface. The long-term performance of the developed microreactor was evaluated. It was shown that not only high nitrobenzene conver- sion but also good stability were achieved in a range of the inlet nitrobenzene concentration from 30 mM to 90 mM. The effects of the gas flow rate and liquid flow rate were also visited. The results showed that for a given liquid flow rate and inlet nitrobenzene concentration, increasing the gas flow rate firstly led to an increase in the aniline concentration and nitrobenzene conversion. Once the supplied hydrogen can meet the complete conversion of nitroben- zene, the aniline concentration became stable and the nitroben- zene conversion was almost 100%. Similarly, for a given gas flow rate and inlet nitrobenzene concentration, when the supplied hydrogen enabled the complete conversion of nitrobenzene, increasing the liquid flow rate showed no effect on the aniline con- centration and the nitrobenzene conversion. However, once the supplied hydrogen cannot meet this requirement, both the aniline concentration and nitrobenzene conversion decreased with increasing the liquid flow rate. It was also found that because of the mass transport resistance of hydrogen between phases, excess hydrogen needed to be supplied as compared to the theoretical values. Excess ratio was thus defined to show this effect. The experimental results revealed that increasing the inlet nitroben- zene concentration and the liquid flow rate could lead to a reduc- tion in the excess ratio as a consequence of enhanced mass transfer.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Therefore, in order to overcome the mass transfer limitation, high pressure is generally required to increase the amount of dissolved\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
