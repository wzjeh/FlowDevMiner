First, the micromixers 1 (with inner diameters of 0.15 mm, 0.25 mm and 0.5 mm) and the capillary microreactors (with inner diameters of 0.5 mm, 0.75 mm and 1.0 mm) were used to explore the optimal equipment that could achieve a better mixing effect. The results are shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b). The results prove that as the inner diameters of the micromixer and microreactor increase, the conversion of 4-MNT decreases under the same reac- tion conditions. Under the same flow rate, the smaller the inner diameter is, the greater the fluid velocity is. The turbulence in the fluid will be more intense. The more sufficient the fluid is mixed, the more conducive to the occurrence of the reaction. Therefore, a better mixing effect was achieved in the micromixer and microreactor with smaller inner diameters. According to the above results, a micromixer with an inner diameter of 0.15 mm and a microreactor with an inner diameter of 0.5 mm were utilized for the next step of the research. To achieve the best mixing effect in the selected micromixer and microreactor, the influence of the fluid flow rate on the conver- sion of 4-MNT was explored. The results are shown in Fig. 2(c). According to the results, when the fluid volume flow rate is lower than 1.0 mL/min, the conversion of 4-MNT increases with increas- ing of the fluid volume flow rate. When the fluid volume flow rate is higher than 1.0 mL/min, with the increase in the volume flow rate, the conversion of 4-MNT is almost unchanged. The results show that when the volume flow rate is increased to a certain value in the selected reaction devices, the mixing effect achieved in the selected micromixer and microreactor has almost no further influence on the reaction rate. Therefore, all the subsequent kinet- ics experiments were studied under the optimal mixing conditions.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

(Cox and Strachan, 1971) However, an accurate kinetics study of 4-MNT nitration has not ever been reported before. More studies on the kinetics of this reaction should be performed. Microreactor could have excellent transfer and mixing perfor- mances because of its micron or submicron characteristic dimen- sions. (Chen et al., 2021; Cui et al., 2020; Han et al., 2019; Sheng et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021) In addition, the residence time can be accurately controlled in a continuous-flow microreactor system. (Barbosa et al., 2005) These advantages in kinetics studies have been proven by many reported heterogeneous nitration reactions. (Kulkarni et al., 2009; Lan and Lu, 2021; Li et al., 2017; Wen et al., 2018) However, the mass transfer resistance in liquid–liquid reac- tion system cannot be eliminated completely. It is reported that 4- MNT has a certain solubility in 95% H2SO4 at 303 K without sul- fonation, and a homogeneous nitration reaction system can be formed. (Andreozzi et al., 1993; Rahaman et al., 2010; Rahaman et al., 2007) In a homogeneous reaction system, the mass transfer resistance between phases could be eliminated. The high mass ratio of sulfuric acid to 4-MNT can not only ensure the formation of homogenous solution, but also effectively reduce the adiabatic temperature rise of the system, which is an effective method to control the reaction temperature. Therefore, more accurate kinetic data of homogeneous 4-MNT nitration in a continuous-flow microreactor system may be obtained. Unfortunately, this work has not ever been tested before. In this study, a continuous-flow microreactor system including a micromixer, a capillary reactor and an online quenching module has been constructed to determine the kinetics of 4-MNT nitration under a homogeneous condition. The requirement of constant tem- perature was satisfied by adjusting the mass ratio of H2SO4 to 4- MNT. It can be proved by the calculation of the adiabatic temper- ature rise of the system. The mass transfer resistance between phases can be eliminated completely. In the microreactor system, the effect of mixing performance, temperature, residence time and molar ratio of reactants on nitration were investigated in detail and the reaction kinetic parameters including observed reaction rate constants separately based on HNO3 and NO2 +, preexponential factor and activation energy as well as their confidence intervals were obtained.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The results are shown in Fig. 3, indicating that with increasing of molar ratio, the conversion of 4-MNT increases. According to the reported literature, (Edwards and Fawcett, 1994; Edwards et al., 1995) when the most of the mixed acid is occupied by H2SO4, as the concentration of HNO3 increases, the concentration of NO2 + increases. Furthermore, the low proportion of water in the mixed acid is conducive to the pro- tonation of HNO3. When the proportion of HNO3 in the mixed acid is large, the concentration of NO2 + will decrease with increasing of HNO3. In this work, a large amount of H2SO4 and a small amount of HNO3 were used to prepare the mixed acid.
