The scope of this hydrogenation was then investigated by using various nitroaro- matics with different functional groups as the reactants (Table 2). First, the compatibility of different functional groups on the nitrobenzene ring was studied. Under optimal reaction conditions, regardless of the ortho, meta, or para substituent groups, the electron- withdrawing and electron-donating groups were well compatible in this reaction, which matched the expectations from the literature [6,15,16,42–50]. Therefore, the corresponding target products were able to achieve high yields (Table 2, entries 1–15). Notably, when more than one unsaturated group was present, only the nitro was hydrogenated tested by HPLC, indicating that the catalyst was highly selective for the nitro group (Table 2, entries 10–15). In addition, when nitropyridines were used as the reactants, the corresponding products could also be successfully synthesized in high yields by this hydrogenation pro- cess (Table 2, entries 16–17), indicating it was a universal continuous-flow hydrogenation method.

Moreover, they extended WC and prepared a bimetallic Ni@WC composite characterized by high activity for the cardanol hydrogenation. Although continuous flow reactors have shown many excellent applications in the field of hydrogenation, they still have technical challenges to overcome when it comes to heterogeneous catalyzes, such as improving catalytic efficiency and maintaining catalyst stability. The catalyst is a core factor in optimizing the hydrogenation of nitroaromatics, whether it is an intermittent reactor for traditional hydrogenation or a microreactor for continuous- flow hydrogenation [14–16]. Couto et al. reviewed the performance of a series of com- mercially available hydrogenation catalysts for nitrobenzene [17]. Although some of these catalysts showed relatively good short-term hydrogenation activity, there remained a pro- portion of catalysts prone to deactivation, as traditional metal catalysts tended to aggregate during application. In the case of microreactors, the packed bed is typically operated for a long time, which makes the catalyst activity and lifetime critical [18–20]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to prepare a highly efficient and stable catalyst for continuous-flow hydrogenation systems. Mesoporous materials are an ideal class of supported materials due to their collapse resistance, large specific surface area, and tunable pore size [21,22]. The large specific surface area facilitates gas adsorption, metal dispersion, and active site exposure, thereby enhancing catalytic activity [23–27]. Liu et al. designed and synthesized a group of ternary Ni–Cr–Al metal oxide composites with an ordered mesoporous structure and tested them for CO methanation to produce synthetic natural gas (SNG) [28]. The optimized ordered mesoporous Ni–Cr–Al catalysts showed better properties of anti-coking and anti-sintering, as well as higher catalytic activity and stability than the traditional Ni catalysts. Xun et al. prepared a group of catalysts of WO3 highly dispersed on mesoporous ZrO2 by hydrothermal treatment and calcination [29]. The obtained 700-C16-WO3/ZrO2 showed excellent catalytic activity in oxidation desulfurization, and the dibenzothiophene in the model oil could be completely oxidized to dibenzothiophene sulfone. Mesoporous materials are thus an important class of catalysts in the field of catalysis and still hold great potential to exploit. In this work, we reported the synthesis of a new hydrogenation catalyst Pd@SBA-15 by an impregnation method that loaded the metal Palladium (Pd) onto the mesoporous material SBA-15 (Figure 1). The active sites and surface area of the mesoporous structure were characterized. The catalyst was then filled into a micro-packed-bed reactor (MPBR) for the continuous-flow hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. The conversion and selectivity of the reactions were optimized, and the stability of the catalyst was also tested. In addition, we also evaluated the scope of this catalysis by varying the functional groups on the nitrobenzene ring.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The results show that the yield of aniline remains at around 96% (Figure 4) with no obvious decrease, indicating that Pd@SBA-15 can remain stable for at least 24 h. The ICP-MS analysis shows that the metal Pd is almost absent from the reaction solution after 24 h, indicating that barely any leaching of Pd from the catalyst occurs (Table S1). In addition, the Pd@SBA-15 was analyzed again after 24 h of reaction. The TEM image (Figure S2) shows that the interior of Pd@SBA-15 remains a regular porous structure, and there are no obvious metal particles, which means that the mesoporous structure remains after 24 h of reaction and there is barely any aggregation of metal Pd.

Traditional hydrogenation has the risk of hydrogen leakage from the equipment, and its catalyst has the disadvantage of being easily deactivated and difficult to recover. In this study, we designed an efficient and stable mesoporous catalyst, Pd@SBA-15, which was constructed by impregnating the nanopores of the mesoporous material SBA-15 with palladium nanoparticles. The catalyst was then filled in a micro-packed-bed reactor (MPBR) for continuous flow hydrogenation. The designed continuous flow hydrogenation system has two distinctive features. First, we used mesoporous Pd@SBA-15 instead of the traditional bulk Pd/C as the hydrogenation catalyst, which is more suitable for exposing the active sites of metal Pd and reducing the agglomeration of nanometals. The highly ordered porous structure enhances hydrogen adsorption and thus hydrogenation efficiency. Secondly, the continuous flow system allows for precise detection and control of the reaction process. The highly efficient catalysts do not require complex post-treatment recovery, which continues to operate for 24 h with barely any reduction in activity. Due to the high catalytic activity, the designed mesoporous Pd@SBA-15 showed excellent catalytic performance as a hydrogenation catalyst in a continuous flow system with 99% conversion of nitroaromatics in 1 min.

From an environmental and economic point of view, hydrogen is an optimal choice for hydrogenation reagents [6]. However, traditional intermittent hydrogenation systems present high safety risks, energy consumption, and pollution, such as hydrogen leakage due to heavy operation and high pressure, which are considered incompatible with the concept of green chemistry [7]. Compared with intermittent reactors, continuous flow reactors have unique advantages, including better heat and mass transfer, smaller reaction volume, and smoother reaction conditions, which significantly improve the intrinsic safety of the reactions [8]. Over the past decade, the use of continuous flow reactors in hydrogenation, nitration, and diazotization reactions has become increasingly common [9–11]. Lebl et al. developed a novel type of catalytic static mixer with a rectangular cross-section coated with Pd/Al2O3 [12]. The catalytic static mixers showed excellent catalytic performance in the continuous flow hydrogenation of nitroaromatics and were applied to the synthesis of a key intermediate for the medicine tizanidine.
