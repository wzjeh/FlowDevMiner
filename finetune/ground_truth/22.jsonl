This could be attributed to the higher mixing eﬃciency in the microreactor. That is, the process from the primary chain to the slightly branched chain and then to the highly branched chain was less aﬀected by the mass transport limitation in the microreactor, which is considered to have a pretty significant eﬀect on the final branching degree. However, for the batch processing, the coupling reaction was restricted by the diﬀusion distance, which would reduce the probability of the contact between chains containing suspended double bonds. In short, the polymers prepared in the microreactor have higher branching eﬃciency because of the reduced diﬀusion pathway; mean- while, possible side reactions such as uncontrollable branches' formation from linear primary chains are avoided benefiting from more homogeneous temperature control. 3.5. Branched Polymerization Performance under a Miniemulsion System in the Microreactor. From the aforementioned branched polymerization kinetics in a solution system, it was found that increasing the amount of branching agent was advantageous for increasing the branching degree, while sacrificing the apparent reaction rate. This dilemma was tried to be solved by utilizing the emulsion system. In emulsion polymerization, each radical is confined to a nanoparticle in the dispersed phase. This is beneficial for suppressing bimolecular termination, resulting in higher polymerization rate and molecular weight.52 However, phase separation and coagu- lation are prone to happen during the emulsion polymerization in tubular reactors without continuous stirring.53 We turned to utilize the high shear device, as the monomer phase in the pre- emulsion was further broken up, with the diameter of dispersed droplets to submicron level, resulting in stable miniemulsion systems for the following polymerization in microreactors.54 In our case, the prepared miniemulsion could be stored for at least 2 months without sedimentation or phase separation. Taking the recipe of BA100−DVB5−DDT2 for example, as shown in Figure 9a, the miniemulsion polymerization took only 15 min to reach over 90% monomer conversion, which was significantly faster than the solution polymerization. Also, the viscosity in the miniemulsion system was lower (Figure 9b), with the viscosity of the output latex below 45 cP even at the monomer conversion of 97%. The blockage happened when the residence time was prolonged to 30 min, indicating that the miniemulsion system was close to the gel point, which was, however, delayed at a very high monomer conversion (>99%). The particle size distribution for all latex samples was unimodal (Figure 9c), and the volume-weighted mean particle\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

However, in contrast to the preparation of linear polymers, the application of continuous-flow reactors for constructing polymers with branched architectures is still in an early stage. Isaure et al.35 reported the synthesis of water- soluble branched poly(dimethyl acrylamide) in parallel tubular reactors. The tubular reactors had higher space-time yields compared to flasks, and the products were slightly diﬀerent owing to the better sealing of the tubular reactors and hence superior exclusion of traces of O2. Liu and Chang36 synthesized dendritic poly(amido amine) in a convergent multistep microreactor system based on an individually designed setup with an interdigital micromixer. The reaction time of each step was reduced from several hours to seconds at room temperature instead of 0 °C required for batch reactors. Wilms et al.37 realized the ring-opening multibranched polymerization of glycidol in a microfluidic device. Such an exothermic reaction benefited from the fast heat and mass transfer provided by microreactors, meanwhile avoiding the time-consuming monomer addition in the batch operation. Combining atom transfer radical polymerization with SCVP, Bally et al.38 reported the synthesis of branched poly(methyl methacrylate) in microreactors. Their results indicated that poly(methyl methacrylate) prepared in microreactors exhibited higher branching eﬃciency than batch reactors. Moreover, the coil flow inversion was applied to further reduce the mass transport limitation rising from the increased viscosity at a high monomer conversion. The improvement on the branching eﬃciency confirmed the eﬀectiveness of this continuous-flow synthesis approach in controlling polymer properties.39\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Therefore, the risk of gelation still exists for the recipe of BA100−DVB5−DDT2, and residence time should be adjusted to avoid the cross-linking by terminating polymerization in advance. In all, the analysis of MWD curves at various monomer conversions revealed the gradual branching process, as the weight fractions of components with diﬀerent branching degrees kept changing. In the early polymerization stage, small and slightly branched chains were formed from the coupling reaction between primary chains. While in the later stage, the coupling between branched chains would become dominant, resulting in the large and highly branched chains with the increase of both molecular weight and dispersity. Still, further work is needed to predict the gel point in the continuous-flow system. 3.4. Comparison of the Branched Polymerization Performance between Microreactors and Batch Reac- tors. The comparison between the capillary microreactor and the batch reactor for the preparation of b-PBA is presented in Figure 8, using the recipe of BA100−DVB5−DDT2. It can be seen that the polymerization was initiated quickly in the microreactor (Figure 8a), owing to its enhanced heat and mass transfer. The reaction mixture could be quickly heated to the set temperature upon entering the microreactor, and the generated free radicals would rapidly contact with monomers to propagate in the narrow confined channel. Instead, it would take a longer time to reach the set reaction temperature in the batch reactor, and the temperature variation of the reaction mixture could reach 5.5 °C, with the temperature being higher than that of the external heating source (Figure S5a). For the continuous process, owing to the small diameter of the capillary microreactor, it was hard to directly insert a temperature sensor into the inside solution. Therefore, a heat transfer model was utilized to analyze the temperature distribution inside the microreactor and the temperature variation was calculated to be below 0.1 °C (Figure S5b). Because of the exothermic polymerization, the produced heat was accumulated in the batch reactor and thus the reaction was accelerated. The batch operation had higher conversion after the reaction time of 40 min compared to the continuous-flow processing (Figure 8a). In particular, for the recipe of BA100−DVB0−DDT0 to prepare l-PBA, the higher the polymerization heat production rate was, the worse temper- ature control would be in the batch reactor. In this case, Đ was 3.4 in the batch operation, larger than that of 2.1 in the microreactor (Figure S6a). Such a low dispersity value obtained from the continuous operation was similar to Iwasaki's report,46 as the microreactor was suitable for the MWD control in highly exothermic systems. Moreover, the Mark−Houwink plots of l-PBA samples from batch and continuous operations overlapped at the molecular weight region below 200 kg/mol, and then the intrinsic viscosity of the l-PBA sample from the flask was clearly lower than that from the microreactor (Figure S6b), which might be attributed to the existence of long-chain branches in the batch process. For the polymerization of BA at high temperatures (>343 K), linear primary chains could be transformed to secondary and tertiary macroradicals because of backbiting (intramolecular chain transfer to polymer) and subsequent β- scission,47 and the following macroradicals' propagation led to the formation of both short and long chain branches.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

It was demonstrated that better molecular weight control and higher branching degree were achieved in the continuous-flow processing.

MWDs of b-PBA along with the monomer conversion were multimodal and they were deconvoluted to reveal the gradual branching process. The increase of the branching degree for b-PBA was reached with the continuous- flow processing, owing to better heat and mass transport capacities in the microreactor compared to the batch reactor. Moreover, the continuous synthesis of b-PBA was promising in aqueous miniemulsion polymerization, exhibiting higher reaction rate, lower solution viscosity, and improved branching degree.

Such results were expected as DDT solely acted as a chain transfer agent and its amount should have no obvious eﬀect on the concentration of radical chains.41 When both the DDT and DVB dosages were increased simultaneously at the molar ratio of 1:1, the monomer conversion gradually decreased because of the participation of more DVB molecules in the copolymerization (Figure S1c). Moreover, the overall chain propagation rate became slower, and the polymer solution viscosity was kept below 10 cP even at the monomer conversion of 85% (Figure S1d). Such a viscosity was obviously lower than that for the FRP recipe (i.e., 45 cP), owing to the formation of the branched structure. Polymer products with various branching degrees were analyzed by triple-detection gel permeation chromatography. Table 1 and Figure S2 show the molecular weight results for the samples at the highest monomer conversion using the aforementioned recipes. The prepared b-PBA samples had Mn of 4.4−20.9 kg/mol and Đ of 2.2−9.0. Both Mn and Đ increased at a higher DVB concentration (Figure S2a). In contrast, they decreased with increasing the amount of DDT (Figure S2c). This was because the length of the primary chain became shorter and the branching process occurred more uniformly, restricting the formation of larger molecules. Mn,LS and Mw,LS also showed similar trends with regard to the eﬀects of DVB and DDT dosages (Table 1). The branching degree is generally described by the mean- square radius of gyration through the LS detection or by the intrinsic viscosity through the DP detection. As the mean square radius of gyration was beyond the detectability of LS detection42 (the values of Mn,LS for some samples in our case were lower than 20 kg/mol), DP detection was employed to\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Through the Strathclyde method, branched poly(butyl acrylate) with diﬀerent molecular weight distributions (MWDs) was prepared by adjusting the feed formulation and the residence time. The dosages of DVB and DDT were controlled to avoid gelation, and their eﬀects on the branching degree of the products were investigated. The multimodal MWDs were deconvoluted to quantitatively study the branching process. The kinetics in batch and continuous operation are compared. Aqueous miniemulsion polymerization with a similar feed formulation was also conducted in the microreactor, enabling faster reaction rate, lower solution viscosity, and higher branching eﬃciency. This study demonstrated the feasibility to use commercial monomers to prepare branched polymers with high functionality and a dense architecture in continuous-flow mode.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
