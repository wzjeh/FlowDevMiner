Eﬀects of flow rate of reaction solution on the yield of azo-coupling reaction The 1(4sulfonicphenyl) -3methyl -5pyrazolone and aniline were selected as the azo coupling component and the diazo component respectively as a model reaction system. The flow rates of the reactants became the main factor aﬀecting the mixing when other reaction con- ditions were determined. As shown in Fig. 4, it can be seen that the yields increased when the flow rates of the reactants increased from 10 mL/min to 60 mL/min. When the flow rates reached 50 mL/min–60 mL/min, the yield reached the highest. However, the yields declined with the flow rates increasing over 60 mL/min continuously. The reason for this phenomenon is that when the flow rates increase, the mixing performance increase in the micro-mixer and the secondary flow is enhanced in the coils. The stronger the secondary flows are, the greater the contact area of the fluids are, which maintains excellent mixing, mass and heat transfer. When the flow rate reaches 60 ml/min or more (mixing rate 2 m/s or more), the residence time of the reactants in the coil becomes shorter due to the increase of the flow rates, resulting in the reaction being incomplete and the yields decline.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

According to the orthogonal test, the eﬀects of three factors on the synthesis process of the azo dyes were obtained. The main factor af- fecting the reaction yields was the molar ratio of sodium nitrite and aniline. The secondary factor was the feed temperature and the last factor was the residence time of diazotization. Combined with the op- timization of azo-coupling reaction conditions, the optimal conditions of continuous-flow synthesis of azo dyes in microreactoras were de- termined as follows: 1) sodium nitrite solution and aniline solution: the feed temperature is 25 ℃, the molar ratio of sodium nitrite and aniline is 1.06:1, the flow rate is 30 mL/min, the residence time is 10 s. 2) coupling components: the feed temperature is 21 ℃, the initial pH value of the coupling component is 10, the flow rate is 60 mL/min, and the residence time is 8 s or more. The continuous-flow synthesis of four model azo dyes and the commercial azo dyes was carried out under the optimized conditions in a microreactor system. The yields of No. 1, No. 2 and No. 4 azo dyes could reach more than 96%. The yield of the No.3 azo dye was more than 90% and the yields of the Orange II, and Methyl Orange were more than 94% under the optimized conditions. The results in this paper show that the continuous-flow synthesis of azo dyes in a microreactor system with a higher flow rate than that of other literatures can also reach a higher yield, compared with the re- actions in the batch reactor. In addition, the continuous-flow synthesis of the azo dyes from the diazotization to the azo-coupling reaction in a microreactor system has not only applied for the synthesis of model azo dyes, but also it applies for the commercial azo dyes. This method also follows the principles of green chemistry, such as less hazardous che- mical synthesis, eﬃcient atom economy, reduction of waste produced for the environmental pollution problems, so this methodology has a very good industrial value.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

It is also important to study the eﬀects of diﬀerent factors of diazotization and azo-coupling reaction respectively in the synthesis of azo dyes in a microreactor system. This paper takes the micromixer system as the core of the mixed reaction unit, and takes four model azo dyes as the reaction system. Firstly, the conditions of diazotization and azo-coupling reaction were explored and optimized with the flow rate varied from 10 ml/min to 70 ml/min, and four model azo dyes were synthesized by continuous- flow method. Although various groups have investigated similar reac- tions in microreactors, there is no detailed research about optimizing the diﬀerent influencing factors of diazotization and azo-coupling re- action respectively in a microreactor system. So we systematically discussed the optimized conditions of the continuous-flow synthesis of azo dyes in the microreactor system. Then, the commercial azo dyes (Methyl Orange and Orange II) were synthesized with the reaction conditions of the model azo dyes.

In addition, the diazotization and azo-coupling reaction are exothermic reactions and isolated diazonium salts are known to be hazardous due to their explosive and unstable nature. Therefore, it is necessary to apply the ice bath as a cooling device. Generally, the ice bath is used to control the temperature of the reactions between 0 ∼5 ℃. However, heat transfer and mass transfer are not uniform in the batch reactor, which leads to decomposition and self-coupling reaction of the diazo- nium salts. In recent years, the development of the microreactor technology has gradually become an important method in the synthesis of azo dyes. The microreactor technology makes it possible to safely perform reac- tions with unstable intermediates [11] as well as those that give rise to explosive [12] and hazardous products [13]. It can also reduce the amount of raw materials and waste generated by increasing the atom eﬃciency of reactions. Because of this, the application of microreactor technology in the synthesis of azo dye is a green chemical process. Hisamoto et al. [14] used microchip technology to carry out a phase transfer azo-coupling reaction. The reactants, ethyl acetate containing 5-methylresorcinol and an aqueous phase containing 4-ni- trobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate, were introduced into the two inlets of the microchip in a biphasic laminar flow reaction system. Compared with macroscale reaction with strong stirring and no stirring conditions, the specific interfacial area of microscale reactions had a larger value. Because of increasing the atom economy in the reaction, the amount of waste generated was reduced at the end. A reaction conversion of almost 100% was attained in 2.3 s. Azo dyes were syn- thesized in a micro-reactor system for the first time by De Mello et al. [11] Three azo dye products were formed with primary aromatic amine as diazo component, β-naphthol as azo coupling component. The yields ranged from 9%–52%. Although the yields were not high, it provided a new way about the continuous-flow synthesis of azo dyes. Yellow pig- ment 12 was synthesized by Pennemann et al. [15] using a microreactor system. The comparison of the results with the batch synthesis of the pigment aﬃrmed the fact that mixing is an important unit operation in the synthesis of azo pigments. Because of the fast mixing in the mi- croreactors, the glossiness (73%) and tinctorial strength (66%) of the yellow pigment were improved and yielded a good quality product. The Sudan II azo dye was formed as a model to optimize the synthesis of azo compounds in a microreactor system by Akwi et al. [16] At optimal azo- coupling reaction temperature and pH, an investigation of the optimal flow rate of the reactants for diazotization and azo-coupling reactions in a microreactor system was performed. Eventually a conversion of 98% was achieved in approximately 2.4 min. The scaled up synthesis of azo compounds in PTFE tube was also studied and the conversion ranged from 66–91%. Then, the authors [17] studied the use of phase transfer catalyst for the non-water-soluble coupling reaction. Under the optimal conditions, a rapid and easy optimization process was established, which yielded a 99%, 22% and 33% conversion of diphenylamine, carbazole and triphenylamine.

The yields decreased significantly when the temperature ranged from 21 ℃ to 41 ℃. The reason for this phenomenon is that when the temperature increases, because of the instability of diazonium salt, it decomposes and releases nitrogen, resulting in the concentration of diazonium salt decreasing and the reaction rate decreasing.

In this paper, an eﬃcient process in- tensification for the continuous synthesis of azo dye is developed by using a microreactor system. Firstly, the reaction conditions of azo-coupling reaction were optimized and a microreactor was utilized as the mixing and reacting unit. 1(4sulfonicphenyl) -3methyl -5pyrazolone was the coupling component and aniline was the diazo component. The results show that the yield of azo-coupling reaction was higher than 96% under optimized condition. Then, the reaction conditions of diazotization were optimized by orthogonal experiments in a mi- croreactor system. Combined with the optimization of azo-coupling reaction conditions, the optimal conditions of continuous-flow synthesis of azo dyes in microreactoras were determined. Then, four model azo dyes were synthesized by the continuous method in microreactors. The yields of No. 1, No. 2 and No. 4 azo dyes were above 96% and the yield of No. 3 azo dye was above 90%. Finally, the commercial azo dyes were synthesized con- tinuously in microreactors and the yields were above 94%.

At the exit, we got azo dyes products.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

[5] They found the nitrosonium ion source HNO3(aq)/HCl(g) was the best and compared with traditional synthesis, azo compounds synthesized in acetonitrile gave very good yields and free of by-products. They de- monstrated that this method produced less amount of waste compared with traditional methods. Nanomagnetic-supported sulfonic acid was used by Kolvari et al. [6] for conversion of several types of aromatic amine, containing electron-withdrawing groups and electron-donating groups. The corresponding azo dyes were formed in excellent yields. There are some advantages of this methods, such as short reaction time, mild reaction conditions, avoidance of harmful acids. What is more, aryldiazonium salts supported on magnetic nanoparticles were suﬃ- ciently stable to be kept at room temperature. Additionally, many other methods for the preparation of azo compounds have been described in the literatures [7–10]. Up to now, the above examples focused on modifying the reaction process of diazotization and azo-coupling re- action. Using diﬀerent compounds that made the reaction process greener and environment friendly. They have accomplished some goals such as short reaction time and less energy required for the process, high yields and low amount of waste generated. On the other hand, process equipment can also be changed to achieve the green benefits and advantages mentioned above. In industry, azo dyes are generally prepared in the batch reactor. The advantages of the method of batch synthesis are simple operation and low cost of the equipment.
