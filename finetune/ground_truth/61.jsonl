Within the given reaction time, if the conversion increases with increasing flow rate, it indicates that mass transfer controls the reaction kinetics. Conversely, if the conversion no longer continues to increase, it suggests that mass transfer effects are eliminated [20]. As shown in the Fig. 4, with increasing flow rate, the conversion of PA remained relatively stable, indicating that mass transfer had very little influence on the conversion, which implies that an ideal mixing state was achieved and the reaction outcome was solely controlled by reaction kinetics. Therefore, the total flow rate of 1.5 mL/ min was adopted for all subsequent experiments to ensure the reaction remained under kinetic control. The corresponding residence times of 2.5 min, 5 min, and 7.5 min,10 min and 15 min were achieved in the capillary microreactors with lengths of 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m and 30 m, respectively.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 3, it could be seen that PA conversion and gem-DBE yield are comparatively lower at the flow rate ratio of 2:1 (QB/QA). This is because when the proportion of the aqueous phase is too high, MeCN, as a co-solvent, is insufficient to simulta- neously stabilize the hydrophobic CBr4, PA and the strongly polar aqueous phase, accordingly bringing about the fluid stratification within the microreactor and forming a heterogeneous system, which thereby results in a lower reaction rate. Conversely, as the flow rate of the organic phase increases (the flow rate ratio reaches 1:1), the proportion of MeCN in the solution increases, and its ability to act as a co-solvent enhances. Through hydrogen bonding, the fluids could mix rapidly and form a homogeneous system [39]. Concurrently, the PA conversion and gem-DBE yield would be increased. However, when the proportion of the organic phase is further increased to 1:2 ratio, although a ho- mogeneity system could be still maintained, the DBE yield would decrease slightly. This slight decrease is likely because the high con- centration of K₂S₂O₈ approaches its solubility limit, potentially reducing the effective oxidant concentration and thus the reaction efficiency. Consequently, the subsequent experiments were performed at a 1:1 aqueous-to-organic phase flow rate ratio to ensure reaction system to be homogeneous.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Contin- uous flow microreactor, characterized by short diffusion distances and high specific surface areas, could significantly expand the interfacial contact between liquid phases, improve mass and heat transfer perfor- mance, according achieving enhanced product quality, reaction effi- ciency and safety [13], which has gained widespread application in fine chemical fields, including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and dyes/pig- ments. For instance, reactions such as hydrogenation [14], oxidation [15], nitrification [16] and polymerization [17] have implemented effective, green and safe production processes through micro-reaction continuous flow technology. In addition, the continuous flow micro reaction system could precisely control the reaction temperature and residence time, realize uniform mixture of the reactants, thereby establishing a reliable platform for kinetic studies [18,19]. In particular, recent advancement in microreactor technology has facilitated the highly selective, efficient and continuous synthesis of free radical re- actions, as well as effective measurement of the reaction kinetics. Zhang et al. [20] tackled the issues of low mass and heat transfer efficiency and poor safety for the oxidative radical reaction of cyclohexane in tradi- tional reactors, they constructed a high-temperature and high-pressure gas-liquid micro-reaction platform, measured the reaction kinetics pa- rameters, and achieved 85 % selectivity of the target product within a residence time of 370 s, greatly improving the reaction efficiency. Similarly, Ma et al. [21] conducted the photobromination radical reac- tion of oximes in a photomicroreactor. Compared to the conventional batch system, the flow process significantly suppresses by-product for- mation through enhanced mass transfer and precise reaction control. Experimental results were employed to establish a kinetic model that could guide the process scale-up in industry. Moreover, for liquid-liquid heterogeneous reaction, micro-reaction technology could also greatly reduce the impact of mass transfer limitations on heterogeneous rapid reaction [22]. Yan et al. [23] investigated the dehydrochlorination re- action of β -chloroalcohol (CHPDA) in a microreactor. By increasing the concentration of NaOH (to 40 wt%) to enhance the concentration gradient and reducing simultaneously the interfacial tension, the effi- ciency of liquid-liquid heterogeneous mass transfer was improved, the reaction time was shortened to 2.7 min (1/20 of that in a traditional reactor), and the hydrolysis of by-products was inhibited markedly, thereby improving the process safety and scalability. Moreover, an ac- curate kinetic model was obtained by dissolving CHPDA into ethanol to construct a homogeneous system. As be well known, the reaction kinetic model is of irreplaceable importance for reactor design, industrial scale up and the understanding of reaction mechanism [24–26]. However, the study on the gem-dibromoenones reaction kinetics remains still scarce up to now.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Subsequently, the influences of NK₂S₂O₈ /NPA, reaction temperature, reactant ratio (NCBr4/NPA) and residence time on the yield and selectivity of the target product gem-DBE were studied. Multi response RSM was employed to simultaneously maximize both prod- uct yield and space-time yield. Under the optimized reaction conditions, an average yield of 76.15 % and an STY of 1.09 mol⋅L−1⋅h−1 were achieved. This integrated strategy offers a viable pathway toward in- dustrial implementation by effectively balancing the inherent trade-off between reaction efficiency and production yield. Furthermore, a ki- netic study of the reaction was performed, and the kinetic parameters were obtained for various K₂S₂O₈ concentrations. The results indicated that the activation energy of the side reaction was higher than that of the main reaction, indicating that lower reaction temperatures favor enhancing selectivity toward the main product. The apparent reaction rate constants for both main and side reactions increased with the in- crease of K₂S₂O₈ concentration. Compared to batch reactor, the micro- channel reactor dramatically increases space-time yield through enhanced mass transfer and precise control. The reaction mechanism was found to follow a free radical pathway, and the attained kinetic model exhibits considerably good agreement with the experimental data.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
