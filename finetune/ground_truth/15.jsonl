The equipment consists of two peristaltic pumps (P1 and P2, Baoding Longer, China) loaded with tubing connected by a T-mixer (SS316, 1.5 mm i.d.) that was connected to a residence loop (SS316, 3 mm i.d., 5 mm o.d.). The reacting tube was immersed in a thermostat- controlled water bath. The flow rate of water was very high compared to the flow rate of the reactants, which would take the reactor to near isothermal conditions. Nitric acid and sulfuric acid solution were pumped into the reactor. After a residence time (τ) in the reacting tube, the reacting mixture was introduced into the dilution tank, and the reaction was quenched by cold water. Solid product was precipitated, and samples were analyzed by HPLC. The optimization of experimental parameters started with varying residence time (τ) and temperature (T), with 98% sulfuric acid, molar feed ratio of 1:HNO3:H2SO4 (F1:FN:FS) = 1:1.2:2.5, and flow rates of nitric acid and sulfuric acid solutions 11.2 and 60.4 mL/min, respectively. This procedure was greatly facilitated by continuous-flow conditions, and a significant number of runs were conducted rapidly in a sequential manner. For the purpose of high eﬃciency, we hope to shorten the reaction time to less than 1 min. Figure 2 shows the influence of temperature and residence time on nitration. It is known, on the basis of the Arrhenius equation, that the reaction rate increases with increasing temperature. When the reaction temperature was below 45 °C, no dinitration product was detected, and excellent selectivity (over 98%) of mononitration product 2 was obtained along with low conversion rate. As the reaction temperature was raised (higher than 55 °C), conversion of 1 could be completed immediately; however, dinitration product 3 and oxidation product 4 (Figure 3) emerged. At T = 75 °C, the reaction was complete within 15 s, but the selectivity for 2 was only 90% (about 9% of 3, and nearly 0.5% of 4). Based on the above results, for the primary purpose of improving reaction selectivity, we tried changing the acids' dosages at low reaction temperature.

A value of LHSV = 240 h−1 provided a better result (entry 3, Table 2). These findings validated that, at low LHSV, the flow regime was laminar flow, for which mixing was relatively slow, so the reaction need a longer τ to complete conversion (entries 1 and 2, Table 2). As LHSV increased, the Re number increased as well, and the flow regime changed from laminar flow to turbulent flow, which improved mixing eﬃciency; therefore, conversion could be completed in a shorter τ (entries 3−6, Table 2). But when LHSV was too high, the reaction conditions changed drastically, causing some hotspots, which led to dinitration and decreased selectivity (entries 5 and 6, Table 2). With these continuous-flow reaction parameters, an excellent isolated yield of 2 was achieved (ranging from 96% to 98%). The objective of a shorter reaction time was achieved. However, the amount of waste, especially diluted sulfuric acid, still needed to be reduced. As stated in the nitration mechanism, sulfuric acid is just a catalyst and dehydration agent. Theoretically, no sulfuric acid is consumed during the nitration reaction, and we aimed to establish that a continuous- flow nitration process that recycled sulfuric acid was possible. The key to achieving this goal was the recycling of sulfuric acid. The concentration of sulfuric acid was then studied when fuming nitric acid was used and the flow rate of nitric acid was 44.8 mL/min. The flow rate of the sulfuric acid solution was adjusted to adapt to the molar feed ratio (FN/F1 = 1.2), and the tube length was adjusted to keep LHSV = 240 h−1. The results in Table 3 reveal that decreasing concentration of sulfuric acid led to a decrease in conversion, and increasing FS/F1 together with reaction temperature at low sulfuric acid concentration will not generate more byproducts. A H2SO4 concentration of 80 wt % can keep the conversion rate and selectivity in balance (entry 5, Table 3). Study of Dinitration. An extra nitration test of mono- nitrated product 2 (Scheme 3) was carried out systematically by varying reaction temperature and residence time with the above optimized conditions, i.e., 80 wt% sulfuric acid, 98 wt% nitric acid, F2:FN:FS = 1:1.2:7.5, LHSV = 240 h−1.

As shown in Figure 5, a mixture of 1 (340 g, 2 mol), water (158 mL), and concentrated sulfuric acid (700 g, 7 mol) was prepared. The mixed solution and fuming nitric acid (154 g, 2.4 mol) were pumped into the reactor by two pumps at flow rates of 350.5 and 44.8 mL/min, respectively. The stream flowed through the mixer with a residence time of 5 s in the reaction tube, which was wrapped with cotton for thermal insulation. The temperature of the reaction mixture at the outlet of the reactor was immediately raised to 100 °C, while the adiabatic temperature rise was about 70 °C. The mixture was then introduced into the dilution tank and the reaction quenched by cold water (900 mL). White solid precipitated immediately. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature.

Recycling of Spent Acid. The waste acid (about 1680 g, about 40 wt% sulfuric acid) collected from the procedure described above was concentrated in a vacuum at 140 °C until the concentration of sulfuric acid reached 80 wt%. At the same time, 830−840 g of water (about 0.1 wt% sulfuric acid) was collected. Both the acid and water were reused, and a small amount of water was added to keep the reactants ratio the same as in the first run. The experiment was carried out under identical conditions (residence time, feeding mole ratio, and total flow rate) and operations as the first run, and resulted in a 98% yield of product 2 with 99% purity.

The much higher surface area-to-volume ratio under flow conditions renders heat transfer highly eﬃcient. Furthermore, safety hazards in handling exothermic reactions associated with explosive reagents are minimized.8 It is particularly advanta- geous to carry out nitration of aromatics in continuous-flow reactors: the reactor dimensions are smaller, reactant inventory at any given time is less, diﬀusion is much faster, and surface-to- volume ratio is higher, which significantly reduces the possibility of side-product formation and significantly improves the safety.
