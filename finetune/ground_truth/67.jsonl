As shown in Figure 7, the bubble size and dispersity both decrease with increasing liquid phase flow rate at a constant gas phase flow rate. As the flow rate increases further, the conversion begins to decrease due to the reduction in residence time.

A stainless steel microfiltration membrane (Figure 3) with 5 lm average pore size and 0.3 mm thickness was used as the dispersion medium. The active membrane area was 10 mm2. The size of the flow channel was 15 mm � 2 mm � 3 mm. The size of the gas buffer reservoir was 10 mm � 5 mm � 10 mm. The liquid phase was pumped into the top side of the membrane (the flow channel) while the gas phase was pumped into the gas chamber. Under the action of pressure difference, the gas phase was dispersed as microsize bubbles when it passed through the membrane into the liquid phase to form a microdispersion system. The formed microdispersion system flowed out of the membrane dispersion module and into a tubular reactor packed with Al2O3-supported-palladium-catalyst. The reactor was made of stainless steel tube with an inner diameter of 10 mm and a length of 50cm filled with catalyst particles. The size of the catalyst particles was around 3 mm and the bulk density was in the range of (0.63 � 0.05) g/mL. In this study, 20.44 g of supported catalyst containing 0.3% � 0.02% (w/w) palladium were used. The reactor was connected to a phase separator with an inner diameter of 10 mm and height of 30 cm.

The significant deviation indicates that the correlations are not suitable for the microdispersion system, which is possibly caused by the different flow patterns between liquid-flow-through-solid-surface and foam-flow-through-solid- surface. In the traditional device, the gas phase and liquid phase concurrently flow through the packed bed, thus the mass transfer process from gas phase to solid surface is con- trolled by the mass transfer of gas dissolved in the liquid from gas-liquid interface to liquid-solid interface. The main fac- tors affecting this mass-transfer process are: the diffusion coefficient of gas in liquid (affecting on the rate of diffu- sion mass transfer) and the flow condition of the liquid (affecting on the convective mass transfer). Thus, Rep and Sc are used in the correlation to predict the mass-transfer coefficient in liquid-flow-through-solid-surface flow pattern. When the gas phase is dispersed as microbubbles into the liquid phase before passing through packed bed, the new flow pattern of foam-flow-through-solid-surface is formed. The flow condition and thickness of the liquid film on parti- cle surface will be different from the traditional process. The microbubble-in-liquid system with the new flow pattern could be considered to be a uniform fluid, which passes through the solid surface and forms fluid/solid system. As is well known that the diffusivity in the liquid phase is much lower than in the gas phase, thus, the controlling step of external mass-transfer is mass transfer of the gas dis- solved in the liquid through the liquid film to the solid sur- face. In this case, Sh number could be calculated with KL and the diffusivity D. D could be considered as the gas dif- fusivity in the liquid phase, which can be determined by Eq. 6. For the new flow pattern, mass transfer will be affected by new factors and new correlation needs to be developed. As shown in Figures 4–6b, KLa increases with the increase in the flow rate of liquid phase, QL, at a constant phase ratio, which is possibly due to the decrease in the liq- uid film thickness on the particle surface. On the other hand, as shown in our previous study,27 the microbubble size is proportional to Q�0:20 L , thus the increase of KLa is possibly due to the decrease in the dispersion size and thus the\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Using the device microbubbles in the size of 10–100 lm were successfully generated with ethyl- anthraquinone solution as the continuous phase. The reaction and mass transfer performance was evaluated and the effects of flow rates, addition of inertial gas (N2 as example), partial pressure of H2, EAQ concentration and reaction temperature on them were studied. By passing the gas-liquid microdisper- sion system through a packed bed reactor the conversion of ethylanthraquinone as much as 35% was reached in less than 3.5 s. The overall volume mass transfer coefficient in the microdisperion system was calculated and the value ranged in 1–21 s�1, which is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the values in the normal gas-liquid trickle-bed reaction processes. The results indicate that gas-liquid microdispersion can make great improvement to solid catalyzed gas-liquid reactions which are controlled by mass transfer. An equation has been developed to correlate the mass transfer in the flow pattern of foam-flow-through-solid-surface with diffusion coefficient, inertial force, thickness of the liquid film and bub- ble size, which shows good coincidence with experimental values.

As shown in Figures 7–9b, KLa does not change at constant flow rates and decreases with the increase in the gas-to-liquid phase ratio at a constant liquid flow rate, QL. The effect of phase ratio on KLa is possibly due to the decrease in the thickness of the liq- uid film as the increase in the phase ratio. As shown in Figure 10b, KLa increases slightly with the increase in temperature, possibly due to the decrease in the liquid film thickness too. As described above, the main factors affecting the mass trans- fer performance of foam-flow-through-solid-surface are: the foam flow condition and the thickness of the liquid film. The liquid film is determined by two factors: the size of the dispersed bubbles and the gas-to-liquid flow rate ratio. As described above, there are new factors effecting the mass- transfer process in the flow pattern of foam-flow-through- solid-surface: inertial force, which affecting on the dispersion size, and gas-to-liquid flow rate ratio, which affecting on the thickness of the liquid film around bubbles.
