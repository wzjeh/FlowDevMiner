Experiments for varying the liquid flow rate were conducted to study its effect on the conversion of o-nitroanisole, selectivity and STY of o-anisidine. All the experiments were carried out at a temperature of 45 ◦C, substrate concentration of 1.2 mol/L in methanol, pressure of 100 psig and a catalyst (2% Pd/zeolite) loading of 13 mg. The flow rate of the liquid was varied in the range of 0.05–0.15 mL/min, and the H2 flow rate was kept constant at 5 sccm. In these experiments, the actual gas flow rate is approximately 10 times the liquid flow rate. Therefore, a change in liquid flow rate does not change the residence time significantly. Fig. 5 shows the effect of liquid flow rate on the conversion, selectivity and STY. The data shows that the conversion decreases with increase in liquid flow rate while the selectivity remains almost constant. However, STY or the overall reaction rate first increases with increase in liquid flow rate up to a liquid flow rate of 0.1 mL/min, and then decreases with further increase in liquid flow rate. In the experiments that we conducted to see the effect of the liquid flow rate at constant gas flow rate, it was observed that the liquid slug length increases with increase in the liquid flow rate. As the liquid slug length increases, the rate of convective mass transfer from gas to liquid decreases (Kreutzer et al., 2001). Small liquid slugs enhance the mass transfer from gas to the liquid. Therefore, conversion and STY increase with decrease in liquid flow rate (or decrease in liquid slug length). However, a decrease in STY below the liquid flow rate of 0.1 mL/min may be attributed to the high conversion of o-nitroanisole under these conditions that results in decrease of average reaction rate or STY. Another method of changing the residence time is to change the gas flow rate. Experiments for varying the gas flow rate were conducted to study its effect on the conversion of o-nitroanisole, selectivity and STY of o-anisidine.

With increase in gas flow rate, the conver- sion decreases while the selectivity remains at almost a constant value of 100%.

With increase in gas flow rates, the residence time of the reactants in the reactor decreases thereby decreasing the conversion. There- fore, higher residence time is needed for high conversion of o- nitroanisole. However, the STY remains the same even at high conversions because the increase in the conversion or yield at higher residence time is balanced by the increase in residence time.

They observed that the conversion in the wafers ranged from 39% to 84%, in comparison to 85% conversion with the fixed-bed microreactor. The reason for this could be that the fixed-bed microreactor offers higher residence time in the re- actor than the other modes of catalyst incorporation in the microreactor module. Although, fixed-bed microreactor offers improvements in thermal management and mass transfer, there are obvious problems of pressure drop with channel dimensions in micron scale especially when operating at high flow rates to increase the production rate. This problem can be overcome by distributing the flow into multiple channels (numbering up) so that the pressure drop in each channel is kept low and the throughput remains the same. Losey et al.

Any of the three methods presented here can be used to change the residence time. However, when the residence time is varied by changing the flow velocity, then an additional variable may be introduced, namely the dependence of gas–liquid mass transfer coefficient on velocity. The effect of velocity was seen by measuring STY at the same residence time, but with different flow velocities. The residence time was kept constant by increasing the amount of catalyst in propor- tion to the increase in flow velocity. Fig. 8 shows the results obtained from these experiments.

Effect of pressure on conversion, selectivity and STY To study the effect of pressure on conversion of o- nitroanisole, selectivity and STY of o-anisidine, experiments were carried out in the pressure range of 50–250 psig at a sub- strate concentration of 1.299 mol/L in methanol, temperature of 30 ◦C and constant residence time. The residence time was kept constant by varying the catalyst loading. Fig. 3 shows a plot of the conversion vs. pressure at a constant residence time of 1.1 s (inlet conditions). Fig. 3 indicates that the conversion remains almost constant with increase in pressure, but the STY increases with increase in pressure in the range of pressures studied. This increase in STY is attributed to the increase in the concentration of dissolved hydrogen with increase in pressure, thereby resulting in a higher reaction rate. However, pressure has no effect on the conversion at constant residence time because the increase in the reaction rate at higher pressure is countered by the decrease in the catalyst loading.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The small channel size of the microreactor enables efficient gas/liquid mixing and sufficient gas/liquid/solid contact for the reaction to be controlled by intrinsic kinetics. A considerable number of studies have been conducted to understand the application of microreactors to gas/liquid catalytic reactions. Monolith structures with channels of about 1 mm diameter have been extensively used for con- ducting hydrogenation reactions of nitro-aromatic compounds (Machado et al., 1999; Andersson et al., 1986; Broekhuis et al., 2001; Kreutzer et al., 2005b) and other compounds (Irandoust et al., 1989; Nijhuis et al., 2003; Kreutzer et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2005). In these reactors, the catalyst is deposited on the walls of the reactor resulting in low pressure drop. Be- sides, the segmented flow in these reactors provides enhanced mass transfer characteristics leading to high reaction rates and thereby, high throughput. A few research groups in Germany have also conducted nitro group hydrogenation in various mi- crostructured reactors using catalysts integrated in the reactor in different forms (Födisch et al., 2002; Hessel et al., 2003, 2004). A microstructured falling film reactor was developed by Institut für Mikrotechnik Mainz (IMM) for conducting the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline where the catalyst Pd was deposited on the walls of the reactor. This reactor offered excellent heat removal capabilities for this reaction and also for the direct fluorination of aromatics (Hessel et al., 2000). They also proved that the conventional equations for mass transfer may not always be applicable in micro scale, and must be ver- ified prior to use. The mass transfer coefficient values of their system were estimated to be in the range of 3.8 s−1 (Hessel et al., 2004), with the interfacial surface area per reactor volume in the range 9000.15 000 m2/m3. This gas–liquid mass transfer rate represents more than a 100-fold increase compared with values reported for conventional multi-phase reactor systems. Therefore excellent heat and mass transfer was demonstrated in a microreactor for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. How- ever, the maximum conversion was about 82% with selectivity to aniline of 80%. Due to the short residence time in the mi- croreactor, it is possible that some of the intermediates would be present in the product stream. Higher residence time is required for aniline formation in a microreactor.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The liquid reactant solution (o-nitroanisole in methanol) was pumped through the system using HPLC pump. The com- bined gas–liquid mixture then entered the reactor. The reactor was made of SS316L with an outer diameter of 1.5875 mm and inner diameter of 0.775 mm. The total length of the packed re- actor varied from 6 to 8 cm of which the catalyst was packed within 1–6 cm of the reactor (depending upon the catalyst load- ing required for the experiment) and the remaining length of the reactor was filled with inert glass beads of the same size range as the catalyst particles. The glass beads were used to pre- vent any fine catalyst particles from clogging the filter placed at the entrance and exit of the reactor. As a result the pres- sure drop across the reactor under all experimental conditions was always less than 10% of the reactor pressure. The reactor was immersed horizontally into a constant temperature water bath so as to maintain isothermal conditions. The pressure val- ues at the entrance and the exit were measured using pressure transducers (PI). From the reactor, the reaction mixture passed through a sampling loop where the product was collected for analysis. From the sampling loop, the reaction mixture passed through the back pressure regulator. The back pressure regu- lator was used to build up the desired pressure during an ex- perimental run. From the back pressure regulator, the mixture passed to a product receiver where the liquid was collected in a glass vessel, and was vented to the atmosphere. Before starting any experimental run, the reacting vapor ef- fluent and product species from the previous run were purged from the system by replacing the reactor with an empty tube, and then nitrogen gas was passed, followed by the pure solvent. The packed reactor for the experimental run was then placed into the system. A reaction run was made by first pumping the liquid (o-nitroanisole in methanol) through the system at a flow rate of approximately 2.0–2.5 mL/min. A few minutes after the liquid emerged at the receiver, the back pressure regulator was partially closed until the desired pressure was attained. The liq- uid flow rate was then adjusted to the desired value, and the back pressure regulator adjusted to maintain the desired pres- sure in the system. The hydrogen gas was then passed through the system. The flow rate of hydrogen was controlled to the desired value using the mass flow controller. The reactor tem- perature was maintained at the desired value using the water bath. After the system attains steady state, the product was col- lected from the sampling loop by by-passing the stream. All experiments were conducted for a minimum period of 8 h dur- ing which the activity of the catalyst was close to its initial ac- tivity. The product samples were collected at regular intervals of 30 min. These samples were diluted with methanol (HPLC grade) and were analyzed using the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) manufactured by Shimadzu. A diode array detector was used for scanning so that the samples could be scanned at multiple wavelengths at the same time. A method was established in the HPLC using water and acetonitrile as the mobile phase, in conjunction with an RP C18 column from Waters Corporation. Calibration was done for both the reactant and the product using standard solutions.

In consideration of all the above, and its special impor- tance to the pharmaceutical industry, the hydrogenation of o- nitroanisole to o-anisidine was chosen as a model reaction in the present study to evaluate the performance of the packed- bed microreactor by studying the effects of various operating conditions on the reactor performance. Also, this reactor was used to study the kinetics of this reaction so that optimum reac- tion conditions can be determined for the design of the multi- channel reactor. The advantages of conducting kinetic studies in microreactor is the small size of the microreactor channel ensures isothermal conditions to be maintained necessary for kinetic characterization of highly exothermic reactions that is not easy to obtain in classical calorimetric or batch systems. Also, the enhanced mass transfer rate in the microreactor en- ables the reactor to be operated in the true kinetic controlled region. The present study provides a detailed study of the kinetics of the reaction in a packed-bed microreactor using 2% Pd/zeolite catalyst.

Effect of substrate concentration To study the effect of substrate concentration on reac- tor performance, experiments were carried out in the con- centration range of 0.4–6 mol/L o-nitroanisole in methanol, temperature of 45 ◦C, 50 psig reactor pressure, and a catalyst loading of 13 mg of 2% Pd/zeolite. The liquid and hydrogen gas flow rates were 0.05 mL/min and 5 sccm respectively. Fig. 9 shows that decrease in o-nitroanisole concentration increases the conversion. The selectivity is lower at higher o-nitroanisole concentration indicating that the rate of in- termediate formation may have a stronger dependency on the o-nitroanisole concentration. The STY increases up to nitroanisole concentration of 2.21 mol/L, and then starts to de- crease thereafter. Mahajani and Haldar (2004) observed similar trend at high concentrations of o-nitroanisole while conducting experiments in a batch reactor. They observed that the rate of o-anisidine formation at high concentrations of o-nitroanisole is low because of substrate inhibition effect present at such high concentrations. Another reason could be that at such high concentrations, external mass transfer resistance may become significant because of the low solubility of hydrogen at high concentrations of the reactant (Brahme et al., 1982).

(1982). The values of kglagl were obtained from the correlations avail- able in the literature. The only available literature providing the values of mass transfer coefficients for packed-bed microreac- tor was that of Losey et al. (2001). They observed that the mass transfer coefficients values of their system were in the range of 5.15 s−1. However, there are no correlations available in the lit- erature for estimating the gas–liquid mass transfer coefficients in a packed-bed microreactor. Therefore, the correlations from trickle-bed (Versteeg et al., 1992; Iliuta et al., 1999) and mono- lith reactors (Kreutzer et al., 2001) were assumed to be the closest approximate for the mass transfer coefficient values in the packed-bed microreactor. The calculated values of �1 using the correlations are much higher than 1 which is highly impos- sible. This suggests that the actual mass transfer coefficient in the packed-bed microreactor is much higher than the estimates obtained from these correlations. Since there are no reliable correlations for estimating the gas–liquid mass transfer coeffi- cients for packed microreactor, experimental verification was considered as the only means of concluding that the reaction is not mass-transfer limited at the gas–liquid interface.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

In the pharmaceutical industry, the heat gener- ated from these reactions usually requires several hundred tons of refrigeration controlled by a centralized system leading to huge energy requirements. Also, the non-uniform temperature distribution in the conventional reactors may develop hot spots on the catalyst surface or may lead to the formation of sev- eral byproduct(s) or intermediate(s) which can also react with one another, and further lead to violent decomposition of nitro compounds or partially hydrogenated intermediates (Stoessel, 1993; Blaser et al., 2001). Therefore, good temperature con- trol within the reactor is essential to increase the selectivity of the desired compounds, and also to prevent thermal explosion conditions. Improvements to the existing reactor systems led to the in- vention of miniaturized reactor configurations such as microre- actors and mini-structured catalyst beds to solve the problems associated with heat and mass transfer in conventional sys- tems. Microreactors are miniaturized reactor systems with re- actor channel characteristic dimensions in the sub-millimeter range. These devices have been investigated for a number of model gas–surface catalytic reactions, liquid-phase, gas–liquid reactions as well as some selected commercial demonstrations like partial oxidation reaction in fuel cells and fine chemicals production. The use of a continuous microreactor for highly exothermic reactions enables uniform temperature control throughout the reactor because of the high surface-to-volume ratio in these reactors. Because the temperature of most of the tubular reac- tors is controlled through walls of the reactor, as the diameter of the tubular reactor increases, the reactor becomes increas- ingly hindered by temperature gradients thereby reducing the reactor performance. This has been demonstrated by Besser and Ouyang (2005) and Besser et al. (2005), who conducted experimental and simulation studies on CO preferential oxi- dation reaction in a microchannel reactor with thin film wall catalyst and conventional packed-bed reactors of 2 and 4 mm diameters. They observed increase in CO conversion with de- crease in the reactor diameter from 4 to 2 mm and further in- crease in CO conversion with the microchannel reactor. The extremely efficient heat removal capacity of the microreac- tor eliminates temperature gradients and prevents the on-set of other side reactions (such as r-WGS reaction for preferential ox- idation) that may result due to temperature gradients inside the reactor. For most multi-phase reactions, which are usually limited by mass transfer effects, the microreactor also offers improved overall reaction rate and reactor performance when compared\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
