The amount of oxygen dissolved in benzyl alcohol is an important factor for the evaluation of the tube-in-tube microreactor.14 When the benzyl alcohol leaves the BPR, the dissolved oxygen escapes from the liquid because of the pressure diﬀerence between the reactor and the outlet. Assuming the residual gas in the fluid at the outlet is the same as that in the inlet (benzyl alcohol presaturated with oxygen at 1 bara and room temperature), the volume of oxygen released per unit volume of benzyl alcohol equates approximately to the oxygen permeated while the liquid is passing through the reactor. This was measured using the traditional buret method.19 During the measurement, the tube-in-tube microreactor was kept at 120 °C, and the liquid outlet was connected to a buret filled with benzyl alcohol (presaturated with oxygen at 1 bara and room temperature). The duration for collecting a fixed volume of oxygen in the buret was recorded for diﬀerent liquid flow rates and absolute gas pressures in the annulus. Thus, the outgassing rate of oxygen could be calculated. The average liquid residence time was calculated by the tube length divided by the superficial velocity of the liquid in the inner tube. From Figure 3, it can be noted that initially the outgassing rate increased gradually with residence time at each set gas\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

To test the packed PTFE reactor under oxidative condition, benzyl alcohol was first saturated with oxygen by a tube-in-tube contactor (100 cm long; gas pressure, 6 bara; liquid flow rate, 0.01 mL/min; Figure 2b). The residence time in the tube-in-tube contactor was about 3000 s, which was long enough for the alcohol to become saturated with oxygen. Under these conditions, no obvious improvement in conversion was obtained. The main diﬀerence between the two feed approaches was the higher selectivity to benzaldehyde compared to toluene. This was due to the additional oxidation of benzyl alcohol (eq 1), besides the disproportionation reaction, because of the small amount of dissolved oxygen present in the liquid substrate. These results confirm the two main reactions of the overall oxidation of benzyl alcohol, according to previous stud- ies.8,24−26 Benzaldehyde, the target product, is formed by both the oxidation and disproportionation of benzyl alcohol, while another main product, toluene, is obtained only from the disproportionation.

CONCLUSIONS A semipermeable Teflon AF-2400 tube-in-tube microreactor was developed for the continuous solvent-free aerobic heterogeneous oxidation of benzyl alcohol. By comparison with nonpermeable PTFE configurations, the packed tube-in- tube microreactor allowed the continuous supply of oxygen during the reaction and therefore significantly improved both conversion and selectivity. The amount of oxygen that permeated played a vital role in reactor performance. Oxygen permeation was increased by increasing the gas pressure and catalyst contact time. When the catalyst was diluted, the average residence time of liquid in the bed increased, allowing larger oxygen permeation. All these approaches of enhancing oxygen permeation resulted in improved reactor performance. Even though the amount of oxygen available for the reaction was not enough to achieve the same total conversion of benzyl alcohol as in a packed nonpermeable PTFE reactor with a mixture of oxygen−benzyl alcohol feed, the selectivity for both reactors was similar. As gas does not come directly into contact with the organic mixture in the packed tube-in-tube microreactor, its intrinsic safety makes this type of reactor promising for wider applications in heterogeneous reactions. ■ AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Author *E-mail: a.gavriilidis@ucl.ac.uk.

It was 1.78% for the conditions of Table 1b and 26.6% for those of Table 1c. This indicates that adding oxygen can accelerate the disproportionation reaction, which agrees well with previous studies that suggest two distinct pathways to disproportionation.25 Selectivities to other products are also listed in Table 1, and the values were all lower than 2%. To further explore the eﬀect of oxygen concentration on the reaction performance, a mixture of oxygen and benzyl alcohol was fed into the packed PTFE reactor (Figure 2c). The gas-to- liquid volume ratio (at standard temperature and pressure, 0 °C, 1.0 bara) was 100, and the outlet pressure was kept at 6 bara. Two-phase slug flow was observed upstream of the packed bed. It can be seen from Table 1d that the conversion was 2- fold higher than that in the tube-in-tube microreactor, with 12% higher selectivity to benzaldehyde. The diﬀerence between the two approaches clearly indicates the deficiency of oxygen for the packed tube-in-tube microreactor for the conditions of Table 1c. However, the packed tube-in-tube microreactor is intrinsically safer as gaseous oxygen does not come in contact with the organic mixture. 3.3. Eﬀect of Gas Pressure in Packed Tube-in-Tube Microreactor. To alter the amount of oxygen available for the reaction, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out with the gas pressure in the annulus changing from 3 to 7 bara. The liquid pressure was maintained at 7.9 bara by the BPR, and the catalyst contact time and reaction temperature were kept the same. The conversion of benzyl alcohol and selectivities to benzaldehyde (SB) and toluene (ST) are shown in Figure 4; other minor products (not shown) were all lower than 2.0%. The total conversion of benzyl alcohol increased gradually with the gas pressure. The highest conversion was 41.5% at 7 bara gas pressure. The same trend was observed for the selectivity to benzaldehyde, which reached 65.1% at 7 bara. As for the selectivity to toluene, it showed an opposite dependence on the gas pressure, decreasing from 36.2% to 32.4%.

The conversion (42.3%) and selectivity to benzaldehyde (68.4%), as well as XO (18.1%), were close to those when catalyst contact time was 230 gcat·s/ galcohol (46.9%, 67.5%, and 18.0%, respectively). Assuming the void fraction of the bed was the same for both conditions, the average residence time for the liquid passing through the bed with the catalyst contact time of 115 gcat·s/galcohol and catalyst dilution factor 2 equaled that when catalyst contact time was 230 gcat·s/galcohol and catalyst dilution factor was 1. Thus, the time for oxygen permeation was also the same. However, the main diﬀerence was that half of the bed in the former case did not contain catalyst.

Assuming that all the oxygen dissolved in the liquid flow (∼0.5 mL/mLalcohol estimated from Figure 3) was consumed through oxidation reaction, the theoretical maximum XO would be 0.43%. Next, the reactor with the catalyst packed in the semi- permeable tube-in-tube microreactor was evaluated (Figure 1). From Table 1c, it can be seen that the conversion of benzyl alcohol increased dramatically compared to the other two approaches at the same reaction temperature and gas pressure. The selectivity to benzaldehyde was about 30% higher than that of toluene. This improvement in the performance of the tube- in-tube microreactor was due to the increased amount of oxygen participating in the reaction, based on the correspond- ing XO. The amount of consumed oxygen calculated from XO is 12.4 mL/mLalcohol, which is ca. 150 times higher than 0.08 mL/ mLalcohol calculated for oxygen-presaturated benzyl alcohol. Comparing this value (12.4 mL/mLalcohol) with the outgassing rate in Figure 3 (∼0.5 mL/mLalcohol) shows that oxygen permeation during the reaction was enhanced, because an oxygen concentration gradient was sustained across the semipermeable tube wall. This makes the packed tube-in-tube microreactor more eﬃcient for three-phase reactions compared with nonpermeable PTFE reactor configurations with oxygen- presaturated feed (Figure 2b).\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
