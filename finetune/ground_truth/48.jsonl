Deviation between glass and AHPCS microreactors is supposedly by the loss of photonic energy that occurred by the scattering of UV at the microchannel. In the range of 4-CP concentration below 2 mM, degradation rates were highly dependent on concentration above 2 mM, it became con- stant at each flow rate, by reaching the saturation stage of injected TiO2 amount. To increase the photocatalytic efficiency, alternative TiO2 packed bed photocatalytic microreactor was prepared by packing TiO2 coated silica bead into the chamber (100 �m of height and 1000 �m of width, and throat barrier of 30 �m width) of AHPCS microchannel for higher capacity and immobilization of photocat- alysts. As shown in Fig. 4(a), 50 �m diameter of silica bead increased to 70–80 �m after coating and turned to opaque owing to TiO2 shell. In addition, TiO2 nanoparticles in the range 300–500 nm were crystallized on the surface of the beads. For identification of TiO2 species for photocatalytic activity, a rutile and an anatase TiO2 were confirmed by XRD (Fig. 4(b)) [11]. Because microbeads were packed in monolayer in microchan- nel, facile flow with low pressure drop were generated, and microbeads were captured by mouth–throat structure at the end of micro channel as shown in Fig. 4(c). As a photocatalytic per- formance indicator, E. coli was prepared. When E. coli broth was injected into TiO2 packed bed photocatalytic microreactor showed sterilization effect by decreasing the numbers of live E. coli to 110 from 9500 in 4.2 �l/min of flow rate, which was verified by 24 h incubation on a nutrient agar plate with eluted sample from microreactor as shown in Fig. 5.

Because it has high surface to volume ratio, diffusion dominated mass transfer effect and easy control- ling of fierce reaction [3,4]. In case of microfluidics, most of cases are glass or quartz based microreactor owing to its optical trans- parency and mechanical stability [5].

And sol–gel process with TiO2 precursor, TiOCl2 or titanium tetraisopropoxide has been applied frequently to form ultra thin film inside the glass microchannel [7].

As shown in Fig. 2, cured AHPCS showed a high transmittance (over 90%) from 300 to 700 nm of wavelength range, which is close to that of PDMS sample having the same thickness. It was observed that the AHPCS samples cured at a higher temperature (160 ◦C) showed a slightly lower transmittance which was attributed to their color change from transparent to yellow tinge. It was supposed that higher crosslinkage degree is achieved in higher curing temperature.
