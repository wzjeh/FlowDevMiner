The Influence of Each Parameter on Continuous Synthesis. Flow Rate. The influence of the total flow rate on the yield of the diazotization reaction was studied. As shown in Figure 7, the increase of the total flow rate promoted the yield of the diazotization reaction, and when the total flow rate exceeded 40 mL/min, the yield reached its plateau. On the one hand, the increase of the flow rate was conducive to the rapid mixing of the two streams in the micromixer. On the other hand, a higher flow rate brought a higher Re number, which means that the greater the disturbance of the fluid in the delay loop, that can delay the sedimentation of particles and facilitate the flow reaction. On this basis, we carried out all the subsequent experiments at a total flow rate of 40 mL/min. Temperature. Figure 8 showed that the reaction rate of diazotization was significantly affected by the reaction temperature. When the temperature was raised from −5 to 5\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

However, diazotization of weakly basic aromatic amines is difficult to be reformed by continuous microreaction technology due to its poor solubility. In this paper, first, by improving the crystallization process, the miniaturization of diazotization with low solid content was realized. The effects of various parameters (flow rate, temperature, reagent dosage, and concentration) on the reaction yield were investigated systematically. As for high solid content, by introducing the gas−liquid Taylor flow and ultrasonic assistance, the mass transfer process was strengthened, and the slurry flow pattern was improved. Finally, at 0.40 mol/L, a residence time of 94 s in the delay loop with a 5 °C cold trap was employed to produce a diazonium salt in 96% yield with high stability. ■ INTRODUCTION Diazonium salt intermediates which have many applications in medicine, pesticides, dyes, and other fine chemical industries1\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

A typical case of diazotization of p-nitroaniline was studied systematically. Through the optimization of the crystallization process of p-nitroaniline, the slurries with an average crystal size of about 56 μm in length and 19 μm in width were obtained, which has relatively good suspension performance. A continuous diazotization reaction with low solid content can be achieved in a simple continuous-flow microreaction system without using other means. The effects of various parameters (flow rate, temper- ature, reagent dosage, and concentration) on the reaction yield were investigated. In view of the situation that slurries with high solid content are easily settled and solid−liquid mass transfer is blocked, the gas−liquid Taylor flow and ultrasonic assisted methods are introduced to further strengthen the circulation in the liquid column. Finally, only a residence time of 94 s in the delay loop at 5 °C was employed to produce diazonium salt in 96% yield with high process stability. Compared to the traditional batch production (1−2 h, ∼90%), the developed continuous-flow diazotization shows a great prospect in industrial application. ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * sı Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.iecr.3c00337.

After testing, the microreaction system ran for 2 h without clogging and significant yield fluctuation. For ultrasound assistance, the enhancement effect is mainly caused by acoustic cavitation, which can induce strong local turbulence in the form of cavitation microbeams, liquid jets, and shock waves. It has been shown that cavitation microbeams generated by bubble surface oscillations and periodic bubble length changes can strongly alter and distort the recirculation loop in the liquid plug, thus enhancing mass transfer.30,31 Here, ultrasound (40 kHz, 360 W) was applied to the reaction in the delay loop (Video S1). The introduction of ultrasound maximized the role of gas in the system. One advantage is that ultrasonic assistance can help reduce the solubility of carbon dioxide and improve reagent utilization, so that more gas can be released, and the residence time becomes shorter (Figure 13). Another advantage is that it can promote gas vibration, so that the gas−liquid two phases collide violently and slow down the agglomeration of particles in high solid content slurries. Benefiting from further enhancement of solid−liquid mass transfer, the reaction efficiency and yield were further improved compared to the single treatment (Figure 14).\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The concentration of the generated azo dye was quantified by UV−vis spectroscopy.17,25 Based on the quantitative relation- ship between the concentration of the diazonium salts and the azo dyes, the yield of the diazotization reaction could be obtained (see the Supporting Information for details). ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

In order to solve the problems of particle agglomeration and channel blockage, we took two measures in this section: the gas−liquid−solid Taylor flow and ultrasound assistance. The gas−liquid−solid Taylor flow has been introduced to address the limitations of microreactors that involved solids. The liquid recirculation flow pattern can suspend, transport, and mix solid particles in the liquid slugs, reducing the risk of clogging.27−29 In our case, as the pressure fluctuation of the solid containing system was relatively large, the introduction of gas through differential pressure by the flow controller was prone to large nonuniformity, which easily leads to instability of the actual gas−liquid reaction process. Considering that the reaction is carried out under strong acidic conditions, a certain amount of NaHCO3 was added to solution A, and the corresponding amount of HCl was added to solution B, so that carbon dioxide can be released when two streams were mixed. It was observed that the reaction liquid flow was segmented by a gas column (Figure 12), which was helpful to strengthen internal recirculation, reduce pressure drop, and minimize back-mixing.

However, in batch reactors, the diazotization reactions have been plagued by process safety due to the potentially highly explosive diazonium salt intermediates, the large associated heat release, and the evolution of nitrogen gas from side reactions. Continuous microreaction technology has the characteristics of high transfer efficiency, controllable process, intrinsic safety, and easy scale-up,2−9 which provides a new method to tame hazardous chemistry. In recent years, researchers have already realized the miniaturization of the diazotization reaction on the microreaction systems in many cases.10−17 Compared with the batch processes, the continuous processes with microreactors can increase reaction efficiency, broaden the operation range of reaction parameters, and improve safety. Through further design and development of the continuous process, side reactions can be controlled, and product quality can be guaranteed. Although many excellent results in diazotization reactions have been obtained by using microreaction technology, still some problems remain to be resolved especially for weakly basic aromatic amines. The diazo components of most monoazo disperse dyes are weakly basic aromatic amines, which have strongly electron absorbing groups in aromatic rings. The introduction of strongly electron absorbing groups can lower the dye excited state energy level, producing the dark effect.

Based on the above understanding, to obtain p-nitroaniline slurries with good performance in the continuous flow, the factors affecting crystal formation such as the stirring rate and the concentration of the initial clear p-nitroaniline solution were studied. The physical collision between stirring blade and crystal leads to crystal breakage and secondary nucleation. As shown in Figure 3, the initial morphology of crystal was acicular. Under the high stirring rate, there was an obvious phenomenon of crystal breakage. With the increase in the rotation speed of the agitator, the crystal size changed with a fast reduction and a following plateau phase (Figure 4). The critical stirring rate was about 1500 rpm in our experiments. A higher initial concentration implies a higher super- saturation, leading to smaller crystals (Figure 5). However, due to the solubility of p-nitroaniline, too high of an initial concentration may have the problem of early precipitation during the feeding process. Thus, we considered 1.0 mol/L to be a preferable choice for the initial concentration of p- nitroaniline. Smaller crystals mean lower sedimentation velocities and are more favorable for flow reactions.

A moderate yield of azo dyes was achieved by a continuous process of diazotization and coupling reactions. The biggest difficulty was in separating the products and recycling the organic solvents, which caused high post-treatment pressure. Similarly, organic acids, such as acetic acid, can be used instead of inorganic acids to achieve an increase in the solubility of arylamines,19,20 but again the problem of postprocessing cannot be overcome. Another solution is using organic reaction systems including organic solvents and organic nitrification reagents, such as tert- butylnitrite, isobutylnitrite, and isoamyl nitrite. To prevent diazonium salt precipitation, organic solvents with higher polarity are generally selected, for instance, methanol, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, and N,N-dimethylformamide. Sanz et al.21 selected tert-butyl nitro as a nitrification reagent, benzyl triethylammonium chloride as a chlorine source, and acetonitrile and methylene chloride as mixed solvents in the continuous process of diazotization and chlorosulfonylation, without the use of acid. This organic reaction system avoided the corrosion of microchannels by the high concentration of hydrochloric acid and was easily performed continuously. As a result, the optimized microreaction platform prepared a series of aromatic sulfonyl chloride compounds with yields ranging from 25% to 90%. However, the reagent cost of this reaction system is too high to form market competitiveness. To sum up, the most effective and economical way is still the aqueous reaction system with sodium nitrite as the nitrification reagent. In this work, we developed a microreaction system for continuous diazotization of weakly basic aromatic amines. The diazotization of p-nitroaniline using the aqueous reaction system as the typical object of study was chosen. By optimizing the crystallization process, the slurries with small particle sizes were prepared, and the continuous flow synthesis under the condition of low concentration (low solid content) was realized without any assistant methods. In view of high concentration (high solid content) conditions, gas phase and ultrasonic assistance were introduced to further strengthen the mass transfer process, improve the dispersion of slurries, and avoid channel blockage. Finally, a stable and efficient continuous process of diazotization with high yield (∼96%), short reaction time (∼94 s), and high concentration (0.40 mol/L) was achieved. ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The formation process of the p-nitroaniline crystal consists of the nucleation and growth stages. Intensifying the burst of nucleation is beneficial to obtain the crystal with a smaller size. Super- saturation is considered to be the driving force for both crystal nucleation and growth. In general, crystal nucleation dominates crystal growth at higher supersaturation, ultimately resulting in smaller size. The slurries with a small particle size are supposed to have a slower sedimentation rate and larger solid−liquid contact area, which are more suitable as starting materials for continuous flow synthesis. Therefore, to keep the supersaturation at a high level during crystallization, the cooling crystallization method of dropping the high-temper- ature initial clear p-nitroaniline solution into the ice water mixture was used. Mixing conditions in a crystallizer can directly impact the kinetics of the crystallization process and the final crystal size.
