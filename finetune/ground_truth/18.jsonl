Even the composition of the mixture at the end of a batch reaction has been reported to contain byproducts, viz. 2-NP, 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid, etc. Since no byproducts were observed from the continuous experiments at 20 °C, further experiments were carried out at higher temperature (30, 40, and 50 °C) by increasing the flow rates (Table 2). The analysis showed that for the experiments at 50 °C, the complete conversion of salicylic acid was observed in less than 7 min of residence time in the tubular reactor and also with the higher selectivity for the desired product, we repeated the experiments with lower mole ratios of SA:HNO3 ≈ 1:3 and 1:1.1, and the results were seen to be unchanged. In order to further reduce the quantity of AcOH such that the desired product is completely soluble in it, experiments were carried out at SA:AcOH ) 1:10. The outlet composition at the completion of reaction showed the complete conversion of salicylic acid with selectivity value of 64.9% for 5NSA with no additional byproduct except 3NSA. At constant temperature and constant mole ratio of SA:AcOH, the selectivity of 5NSA was seen to increase with the concentration of nitric acid. Also, the time required for complete consumption of salicylic acid was seen to decrease with increasing concentration of nitric acid. In all these cases, at the suitable residence time when the salicylic acid is completely consumed, the products were seen to be only the mononitro derivatives of the salicylic acid. The continuous flow experiments further showed that, at constant mole ratio of salicylic acid to the nitrating agent, the selectivity of 5NSA increased with increasing temperature. Since the data shown in Figure 4A belongs to the complete conversion of salicylic acid, the higher concentration of nitric acid was seen to affect both the residence time required to achieve complete conversion in the reactor tube and also the selectivity of the desired product.

The better con- ductivity of metal, high heat transfer area, and the specific residence time helped to practically bypass the byproduct formation in this process. The experiments at different temper- atures showed a positive relationship between the selectivity of 5NSA and temperatures. Also, a higher amount of the nitrating agent was seen to reduce the reaction time and achieve higher selectivity for the desired product. Lower amounts of acetic acid were seen to lead to precipitation of 5NSA in the tubular reactor, causing blockage. A continuous flow experiment at 50 °C with 7 min residence time for 2 h yielded consistent outlet composition. Although the higher amount of acetic acid is needed to keep the desired product in solution, complete recycle of acetic acid would help to reduce the acetic acid inventory.

On confirming the entire procedure and the analysis method, we extended it for the continuous flow experiments. For the continuous flow experiments, typically the experi- mental setup involved two HPLC pumps (Laboratory Alliance, U.S.A.) followed by a micromixer, which was then connected to a 12 m long stainless steel (SS316) tube (1/16 in. o.d. and 1.38 mm i.d.). The SS tube was immersed in a thermostat (Julabo - ME12, Germany), and the samples were collected at the outlet of the tube. The residence time was varied by changing the flow rates. Experiments were carried out at different conditions as shown in Table 1. The samples were collected in glass vials immersed in an ice bath (to quench the temperature of the reacting mixture and thereby avoid any further reaction), and after getting volume sufficient for analysis, the unreacted nitric acid was removed by adding urea in methanol solution. The supernatant was subjected to analysis after further dilution. It is necessary to note that the results from the HPLC analysis were based on calibration of the column response for different concentrations of the reactants and the products.

These advantages of microreactors are now known, and as a result, they have been used for the continuous flow synthesis.1-8,10\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

To the withdrawn samples, a solution of urea in methanol was added for denitrification.27 The mobile phase used for analysis consisted of 80% buffer (vol %: CH3OH 5%, H3PO4 0.4%, H2O 94.6%) and 20% of acetonitrile. For all analyses HPLC grade reagents were used. The HPLC analysis was carried out at three different wavelengths, viz. 240, 280, 350 nm; the column temperature was maintained at 25 °C; and the flow rate was set at 1 mL/min. As a part of the analysis procedure, mononitro derivatives were obtained (A solution of 2.5 g of salicylic acid in 40 mL of acetic acid was heated at 50 °C. Eleven milliliters of concentrated HNO3 was slowly added to the above solution and stirred for 10 min.

The solid products isolated in these two steps were analyzed using NMR (NMR spectra were recorded in D2O/NaOD. The 1H measurements were carried out on a Bruker AV 400 NMR spectrometer). The proton spectrum (shown in Figure 1) confirmed the first crop to be 5NSA (also confirmed by measuring its melting point ∼230-232 °C),and the second crop of nitrated product was found to be a mixture of 3and 5-mononitro salicylic acid (1:1).

The LC/MS analysis of the products showed the existence of a byproduct 3,5-DNSA. Moreover, some amount of SA was seen to remain unconverted. This was clearly due to poor mixing and heat transfer that can be achieved in batch mode. Further to this, we operated the continuous flow microplant for the specific conditions (SA:HNO3 ) 1:3, SA:AcOH ) 1:10, T ) 50 °C) continuously for 2 h. The residence time in the tube was maintained at 7 min, and samples were taken intermittently to check the composition and analyzed using HPLC. The results were seen to be totally consistent and yielded only the mononitro salicylic acid. These experiments were also repeated with a higher amount of acetic acid (SA:AcOH ) 1:16) and were seen to yield identical results. Thus, in order to avoid the possible precipitation of the desired product in the tube and still get better selectivity at complete conversion, it was necessary to work with higher amounts of acetic acid (SA: AcOH ) 1:10). Although higher amounts of acetic acid are needed, the separation of acetic acid from the product needs to be dealt with separately as its recycle would be cost-effective. With a suitable recycle mechanism, with a suitable numbering- up strategy (to produce as much as a few kilograms per hour) it would certainly be possible to use this approach for the continuous production of mononitro derivatives of salicylic acid. Further, we would extend the existing experimental system to continuous selective reduction of 5NSA to 5-amino salicylic acid. The intricacies involving continuous removal of HNO3, selective separation of 3NSA from the mixture, feasibility of reduction in the presence of excess acetic acid, and continuous three-phase reduction under pressure will be dealt with separately.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

It was observed that, although replacing the HPIMM micromixer with the T-mixer helped in eliminating the blockage in the mixer itself, for the SA:AcOH mole ratio in the range of 1:3 to 1:9, the product clogged the tube completely, and practically nothing came out of the tube. This was also observed for different orientations of the coiled tube (vertical, horizontal, etc.) and also for the tube of larger diameter (3.175 mm o.d. and 2.77 mm i.d.) even in a serpentine configuration oriented horizontally. On removing the clogged compound, it was confirmed to be 5NSA. In order to avoid such situations, the mole ratio of SA:AcOH was taken as 1:16, and the experiments were carried out without any blockage problems in the entire setup. In all these experiments, the mole ratio of SA:HNO3 was maintained at 1:5. The observed outlet yields at 20 °C at different residence times (for continuous mode) or sampling times (for batch mode) are shown in Figure 3. The results from the batch experiments (mainly carried out to verify the analysis approach quantitatively) were compared with the reported data in Andreozzi et al.25 at identical conditions and were seen to agree well. It can be seen that the percent yield of 5NSA observed in the continuous experiments in the tube of 1.38 mm i.d. was better than that of the batch experiments. It needs to be noted that, although in the batch as well as the continuous experiments the SA:HNO3 mole ratio was maintained the same, the continuous flow experiments contained very high amounts of AcOH, resulting in lowering the overall concentration of the reactants. Importantly, the continuous flow experiments yielded only the mono-NSA as products, while in the batch experiment we observed 3,5- dinitrosalicylic acid as a byproduct along with the mono-NSA. It needs to be mentioned that the measured area available for heat transfer per unit volume of fluid was 3318.63 m2/m3, which was sufficiently high to maintain the constant temperature in the entire reaction tube.

Nitration of aromatic compounds is usually exothermic and fast, and in the presence of excess nitrating agent or at higher temperatures, it can undergo polynitration.12,13 In many aromatic nitrations to avoid the effect of high temperatures that may be generated in the presence of excess nitrating agent, convention- ally, the nitrating agent is slowly added to the aromatic substrate (which can be in the form of solid or liquid). To overcome this situation due to poor heat transfer in the system, in the past few years, the advantage of high heat transfer area and better mixing in microreactors is exploited to check the feasibility of nitration of aromatic compounds. Some of the important initial studies include the following: (i) Burns and Ramshaw14 have reported the nitration of benzene and toluene using mixed acids in a microreactor. In their experiments, the two-phase slugs were generated using a \"T\", and the reaction was studied in SS tubes (127, 178, and 254 µm i.d., 1/16 in. o.d.) and PTFE tubes (127-300 µm i.d., 1/16 in. o.d.). For all the experiments, acid to organic flow ratio was maintained at 10.5, while the benzene to nitric acid mole ratio was in the range of 0.8-1.8. With similar experiments of toluene nitration in a 150 µm PTFE tube, these authors have shown that higher concentration of H2SO4 pushes the reaction in mass transfer limited regime and smaller diameter tubes yield better initial nitration rates.

Thus, if proven efficient, a technology for the synthesis of 5NSA based on continuous flow chemistry using microreactors can be extended for further continuous reduction to yield the desired 5-ASA. In this work, we deal with the first step only, and we bring out several of our observations that would be useful for the researchers who would like to work on analogous systems. The second step of continuous reduction of 5NSA will be discussed elsewhere.

In the rest of the manuscript, we bring out the new findings from our studies and also compare them with the relevant literature.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

This is usually found due to higher rate constants for the favored reaction. The data from the literature21 show that the pre-exponential factor (k0) for the reaction yielding 5NSA is 1.83 times higher than that of for the 3NSA, while the activation energies of these nitrations are of similar magnitude. As a result with sufficient excess of nitric acid, 5NSA formation is always favored. Further, at any given reaction temperature, the rate constants for the consecutive reactions involving 3NSA are higher than that of the reactions involving 5NSA. As a result, the possibility of extent of reduction in the concentration of 3NSA by successive nitration or decarboxylation is higher than that for the 5NSA. This situation even prevails for the lower SA:AcOH ratio as the 3NSA remains dissolved in the solution while 5NSA gets precipitated as a result of the competitive solubility. This overall situation favors increase in the selectivity of 5NSA with increasing temperature. In an analogous approach of using continuous flow for nitration of aromatic compounds, a recent patent26 illustrates that the reaction time for nitration of salicylic acid can be reduced to as low as 10-30 s using a glass microreactor at 75 °C with other conditions given in Table 1. In the reported experiments, although the conversion is not complete, the ratio of 5NSA:3NSA was in the range of 1.6-1.7 with many additional byproducts. In comparison to that, we had observed complete conversion of the reactant (SA) and very high yield of 5NSA with practically no byproducts as reported in the literature. One of the main reasons was that the use of a metal tube (which has much higher thermal conductivity thereby achieving better heat transfer) for this reaction helped to maintain almost isothermal conditions in the reactor. The simulations of this system as a plug flow reactor (not shown here) clearly indicated that, with the inlet composition and the inlet temperatures, the extent of variation in the temperature in the tube was less than 0.5% of the temperature of the fluid surrounding the tube. The batch experiments carried out at identified conditions showed the selectivity of 5NSA to be closer\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
