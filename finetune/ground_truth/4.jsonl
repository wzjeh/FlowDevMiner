Effects of total volumetric flow rate With a given residence time and constant tube diameter, a longer tube is needed to achieve a higher total volumetric flow rate.

Effects of the reactor tube inner diameter It is well known that the size of the reactor tube inner diameter has a great influence on the gas–liquid flow dynamics in the microchannel as the linear velocity of the fluid changes at a given volumetric flow rate, that further affect the mass transfer and ultimately the reaction out- comes. Fig. 14 depicted the influence of the reactor tube inner diameter on the yield of the benzaldehyde and the flow state within the micro- channel operated at a constant volumetric flow rate. When the reactor tube inner diameter decreased from 1.59 mm to 0.5 mm, the yield of benzaldehyde increased approximately in linear from 14.67% to 35.39%. This was primarily due to the fact that the mixing process in the liquid phase and the mass transfer process between two phases were enhanced by decreasing the inner diameter of microchannel. Firstly, as the total volumetric flow rate and gas–liquid flow rate ratio were kept constant (e.g., 99 μL/min), the overall apparent linear velocity increased with the decrease of the inner diameter. Subsequently, the internal circulation and mixing in the liquid plug were enhanced, as discussed above, which accelerated the regeneration rate of the liquid film side at the gas–liquid phase interface and enhanced the mass transfer in the liquid phase. Secondly, when the tube inner diameter decreased, the formation frequencies of bubbles and liquid plugs increased, on the contrary, the lengths of bubbles and liquid plugs decreased accordingly, as evidenced in the experiments with the inner diameters of 0.5 and 1.59 mm displayed in Fig. 14(b). In that case, the specific phase interface area between the gas and liquid phases and the mass transfer rate of O2 to the liquid phase increased, respectively. Finally, in order to keep the total volume of the microchannel constant, the length of the tube must be extended due to the reduction of its inner diameter.

With the given tube length the residence time of reactants in the microchannel reduced with the increase in gas flow rate, thus total flow rate. It was observed that under these operating conditions, the effects of the reduction in residence time on the yield of benzaldehyde were significantly stronger than that of the enhancement of mass transfer process, therefore, the yield of benzaldehyde decreased. Under these experimental conditions, the optimal yield of benzaldehyde was found at the gas–liquid volumetric flow rate ratio of 99 for both tem- perature levels of 393 K and 403 K.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The critical turning point was around the total volu- metric flow rate of 820 μL/min in all three profiles. Also, a higher temperature resulted in a higher yield while all three profiles of product yield showed a similar trend. As discussed, in order to keep a constant residence time, different lengths of tubes with a given inner diameter were used at different total volumetric flow rates. It was observed that when the total flow rate increased at a given gas–liquid flow ratio, the length of gas bubbles decreased noticeably, from 2.51 mm to 1.95 mm in responding to the total flow rate increase from 550 μL/min to 1720 μL/min, as observed in the middle of the reactor tube (Fig. 12(b)). This reduction in gas bubble size further led to an increase in the interfacial area between gas and emulsion phases, thus enhancing interfacial mass transfer performance. This was in line with the above investigation on the effect of tube length (Fig. 11(c)). Furthermore, this flow pattern change enhanced the in- ternal circulation of liquid plug and mass transfer across gas–liquid interface with the increase of the total volume flow rate. Therefore, the conversion of benzyl alcohol and the yield of benzaldehyde increased with the increase of the total volume flow rate (<820 μL/min). When the volume flow rate was greater than 820 μL/min, the yield of benzalde- hyde was almost unchanged with the increase of the total volume flow rate. This indicated that the effect of the mass transfer resistance on the conversion of benzyl alcohol could be neglected at the higher total volume flow rates (greater than 820 μL/min), and the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol was controlled by the intrinsic kinetics in the range of the total volumetric flow rate.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Effects of the volumetric flow rate ratio of gas/liquid two phases As demonstrated above, the variation of gas bubble size clearly affected the interfacial mass transfer area, and thus the reaction per- formance. This was further investigated by varying the volumetric flow rate ratio in a wider range of 81–117, by changing the gas volumetric flow rate in the range of 810–1170 μL/min whilst keeping liquid volu- metric flow rate at 10 μL/min constant. Fig. 13 displays the profiles of product yield as a function of gas/liquid volumetric flow ratio at two temperature levels, and visual observation. The experimental results (Fig. 13(a)) showed that the yield of benzaldehyde increased initially with the increase of gas/liquid flow rate ratio, reached a maximum point at a flow rate ratio of 99, that was followed by a decline. This trend exhibited at both temperature levels, where a higher temperature resulted in a higher product yield as expected. There were two main factors contributing to the increase of benz-\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

These effects were charac- terized by varying the reactor microchannel (or tube) length in the range of 0.5–8.0 m under identical operating conditions. The experiment re- sults are plotted in Fig. 11. The reaction conversion, selectivity and total (gas–liquid-solid) volumetric flow rate as a function of tube length at three temperature levels of 383 K, 393 K and 403 K are investigated. As displayed in Fig. 11(a), the conversion of benzyl alcohol increased approximately linearly with the increase of the reactor tube length, though tending to level off with further longer tube. The overall profile trend appeared at all three temperature levels, where a higher temper- ature resulted in a faster reaction rate as expected. It was clearly found that the selectivity of benzaldehyde was mostly greater than 99.7%, although a very slight drop was seen in the longer lengths (Fig. 11(b)). Under the experimental conditions, the flow pattern of the gas–liquid two phases in the microchannel was generally maintained as slug flow, the most stable flow pattern in the gas–liquid multiphase microfluidics. The effects on benzaldehyde yield by increasing the tube length could be explained in threefold. Firstly, with the increase of tube length, the residence time of reactants in the microchannel increased, providing a longer reaction time for the benzyl alcohol to be converted into\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The optimal CB range was found to be is 2.0–5.5 wt% under the operation conditions. (4) The yield of product benzaldehyde increased with the increase of total volumetric flow rate before levelling off at 820 μL/min, indicating that the effect of mass transfer resistance on the con- version of benzyl alcohol was neglectable at the higher total volumetric flow rates (>820 μL/min), where the reaction process was controlled by the intrinsic kinetics. (5) A mass transfer model was proposed mapping the mass transfer pathways in the Pickering emulsion assisted catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in a Taylor flow microchannel reactor in order to gain insights into the mechanism of the multiphase transport reaction system, involving mass transfer across both gas–liquid and oil–water interfaces.

Although the coated thin film is well suited for fast reactions due to the enhanced internal diffusion rate, there are some inherent drawbacks, such as the limited amount of catalyst loaded, easier washing away of the catalytic active components, and the difficulty of regenerating deactivated cata- lysts [18,19]. An alternative approach is to pack the microchannel with the solid catalyst particles having a diameter in the range of microme- ters. This can be considered as a micro-packed bed reactor [20–22] having advantages such as simplicity for catalysts replacing and good catalytic performance. However, the drawback of this type of micro- reactor includes high pressure drops, severe wall effects, poor unifor- mity of catalytic bed and reproducibility [23–25]. To address these issues, the concept of micro-suspended reactor has been recently pro- posed [19,26], which also overcomes the problem of catalyst loading and transportation, opening up a new direction for handling solid par- ticulate catalysts in microchannel reactors. However, the process is linked to several technical challenges, such as adhesion phenomena. This occurs when the catalyst particles come into contact with the channel wall, potentially leading to the obstruction of the channel in the most severe circumstances. This is largely attributed to the size of solid catalyst particles, which typically range in the nanometer scale and\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

As it was above 5.5 wt%, nevertheless, a large number of catalytic solid particles entered into the continuous phase, which could be approximated as a suspension composed of solid particles and a continuous phase. Also, at high temperatures and low flow rates, the catalytic solid particles had more chances to adhere to the microchannel wall because the continuous phase of Pickering emulsion was in direct contact with the channel wall. Based on the above analysis, the CB range of 2.0 wt% to 5.5 wt% was considered to be appropriate for a stable operation in the given temperature range.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The FEP reaction tube was heat- ed through an oil bath. In this experiment, the inner diameter of the microchannel reactor was about 0.5 mm, the heat transport rate was very fast. Therefore, the set temperature of the oil bath was considered as the same as the reaction system. Additionally, in the Pickering system, catalytic particles were always in close contact with the aqueous phase, effectively reducing thermal lag.
