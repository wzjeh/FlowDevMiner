Additionally, we highlight our reactor system and approach to do early-stage screening of catalytic materials. Clearly, the predominant choice of reactor for testing new catalysts in the literature is batch reactor, typically utilizing milligram quantities of catalyst. However, a common limitation across reported batch reactor studies can be clearly observed. Test conditions are often constrained to fixed values of temper- ature, pressure, and concentration, with only a single work presenting an extensive analysis across a broad spectrum of conditions (17 variations in temperature, pressure, and concen- tration). Furthermore, reaction times in batch reactors typically span from minutes to hours, with none achieving reaction times on the scale of seconds. Catalyst stability assessments in batch reactors typically involve multiple reuse experiments, ranging from 3 to 6 cycles. In contrast, flow reactor testing proofs valuable to address these raised limitations. In all reported studies, flow reactors offer distinct advantages by enabling testing across a broader range of temperature, pressure, and concentration conditions, while also facilitating extended time- on-stream stability testing, with residence times ranging from seconds to minutes, and in some instances, hours. However, flow reactor introduces additional complexity, particularly when processing gas-liquid-solid multiphases reaction system. Our study highlighted this critical factor that is why maintaining Taylor flow was essential to get reproducible results. Regarding the performance of the Pd@UiO-66 catalyst in this work, it exhibits satisfactory conversion, selectivity, and stability compared to other reported catalysts, even under milder reaction conditions. Notably, the entire reaction process occurs within seconds, a departure from the typical literature reports, and multiple conditions were evaluated smoothly, including effective time-on-stream stability testing, demonstrat- ing the efficiency of flow reactor-based approaches over tradi- tional batch methods.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

While catalyst testing in packed-bed reactors with diameters larger than 4 mm is well-established, significant differences in testing results are observed in reactors with smaller channel diameters, particularly micro-packed-bed reactors, especially in multiphase flow systems.[22–24] Among various flow regimes in microreactors, Taylor flow stands out due to its well-controlled interface, enhanced mixing and heating, and minimized back\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

For all conditions, the rate of reaction was the highest for phenylacetylene, followed by styrene, and then ethylbenzene. Increasing the pressure and temperature, in the beginning, increases the initial rate of reaction in a linear way. However, it started to level off at higher pressures and temperatures, indicating that the rate of reaction started to reach a limit. At higher temperatures, this explained by the balance reached between increasing the rate of reaction with the reduced H2 solubility. The balance reached at higher pressures indicating that the rate of the reaction could be limited by another factor. Most probably this is caused by the rate of internal mass transfer which is dominant for larger catalyst particle sizes, larger than tenths of micrometers.[62] Using the trend for the initial increase in PA rate, a reaction order of one can be assumed for hydrogen and PA which matches the literature.[63]\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
