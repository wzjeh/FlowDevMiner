Safety can also be improved and production enhanced by avoiding large reactors. A group of materials have been used to fabricate the microchips, but in most of the previously reported work, glass substrate was mainly chosen for organic synthesis. Although glassware is dominant in chemistry laboratories, the glass microreactors are normally expensive due to their tedious fabrication process, which limited their extensive use in synthetic organic chemistry. Therefore, developing new microreactors that are inexpensive, simple to build, and easy to modify is still of great significance. As an alterna- tive, microchips made of plastic are becoming popular, particularly in analytical arena. Cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) has recently emerged as a highly attractive substrate material for microfluidic devices, due to its promising properties such as exceptionally good resistance to com- monly used polar solvents, high optical transparency in the near UV range and ease of fabrication, etc. Since it is highly transparent at shorter wavelengths, the surface of COC can be easily modified by photografting method, which makes further immobilization of metal catalysts or other functional groups easy. Transition metal-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reac- tion is one of the most commonly used methods for carbon–carbon bond formation in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry due to its good selectivity and versatile nature. However, homogeneous catalysis with soluble palladium catalyst experienced difficulty in their recovery of catalysts and purification of products. Devel- opment of more efficient heterogeneous catalytic system is a very hot topic. Various effective methods have been developed in recent years (Molna´r 2011; Suzuki 2005; Doucet 2008; Singh et al. 2008; Carey et al. 2006). Tra- ditional carriers of heterogeneous catalysts are porous materials, but more and more evidences indicated that mesoporous materials which with uniform pore structure might provide better catalytic efficiency. Microfluidic channels, which are small in size and highly uniform in shape, may be used both as the reaction containers and catalyst carriers. With this type of flow system, the col- lection and isolation of products can also be greatly sim- plified. The potential of high integration of microchannels might make it possible to screen the reaction condition and catalyst composition in high-throughput with very little consumption of reagents and less waste produced. Suzuki cross-coupling, which was catalyzed by palladium com- plex, is therefore a very good model reaction to check the efficacy of microfluidic devices as a platform of hetero- geneous catalysis. Attempts to perform Suzuki reaction in microfluidic format have been reported previously. For example, He and co-workers (2004) have developed\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

This could be attributed to the advantages that offered by microfluidic channels, in which the smaller axial distances and laminar flow pattern might facilitate the substance exchange (reac- tant reaching and product leaving the active sites). In con- ventional flow-based heterogeneous systems, because quite lots of active sites of the catalysts locate deep inside of micropores, substance exchange between the main flow stream and the active sites might be retarded. In stirring systems, the catalyst particle might move together with the solution layer that enwrapped the particle, which could not effectively improve the substance exchange inside deep pores. In an open micro-channel, the active sites at the surface of the channel are uniformly exposed to the solu- tion, as long as the channel is thin enough, the flow in the channel can effectively bring the reactants to the surface and take the products away, which is critical for better catalytic performance. The maximum channel size that can take advantage of this benefit was also related to the linear flow velocity and reaction rate happened on the channel surface. For the cases in which the flow velocity is around several millimeters per second, channels thinner than 200 lm in diameter should be applicable for catalytic reaction.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Palladium complex was immobilized on a photochemically grafted layer of polymerized N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]methacrylamide. Surface modification and catalyst immobilization onto COC were systematically characterized with streaming potential, surface contact angle, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray photo- electron spectroscopy. The reactor was comprised of a single 15 cm long serpentine channel of 120 lm (i.d.) and exhibited high efficiency for the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of aryl iodides and bromides with arylboronic acids, affording good to excellent yields of the corre- sponding products. The reactions could be carried out smoothly with reduced reaction time and lower reactant consumption in the microreactor thermostated at 50�C. The proposed system may have great potential for high- throughput screening of catalysts and reaction conditions.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Electron-donating groups like methoxy and methyl on the arylboronic acids gave high yields of the corresponding products (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). It could also work well for arylboronic acid with an electron-withdrawing formyl group (Table 2, entry 3). As proposed by Miyaura and Suzuki (1995), oxidative addi- tion is often the rate-determining step in a catalytic cycle. Therefore, aryl halides activated by electron-withdrawing groups including acetyl and nitro are more reactive to the oxidative addition than those electron-donating groups, thus excellent yields could be obtained (Table 2, entries 7 and 8). For example, in the cross-coupling reaction of iodobenzene with 4-tolyl-boronic acid (Table 2, entry 2; the solution-catalyst contact time was less than 1 min and product collected over a 30-min period), comparative yield was obtained with the reported reference method which was carried out in organic monolith supports-based mic- roreactor (Go¨mann et al. 2009; the solution-catalyst contact time was ca. 45 min and product collected over a period of 48 h). In addition, for the coupling reaction of 4-bro- mobenzonitrile with phenyl boronic acid (Table 2, entry 8), similar yield was obtained with that of reported method which was performed in microreactors using syringe pump- driven flow and a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst (He et al. 2004). However, in the later system, the reaction was carried out at a measured temperature of 90–98�C achieved with microwave enhancement (50 W). In general, the heterogeneous catalysts with larger sur- face-area-to-volume ratios were often adopted to improve the catalytic performance in the conventional synthesis due to better molecular diffusion and heat transport they provided. Similar strategies have also been used in micro- fluidic devices (Jones et al. 2009). Although the surface-to- volume ratio of the microchannel we used is not as large as that of porous materials, good overall performance was still\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
