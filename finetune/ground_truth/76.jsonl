Commercially available H2 (99.995%) was used as received. In a typical experiment, the Pd-MonoSil catalyst (0.154 g, 1.3 Pd wt%) was first washed under flow with deaerated methanol at a flow rate of 0.15 mL min−1 at room temperature. No leaching of Pd was observed. A deaerated solution of the substrate (cyclooctadiene or 3-hexyn-1-ol) in methanol (0.1 and 0.2 M, respectively) was then allowed to flow through the cladded Pd-MonoSil catalyst (0.154 g, 1.3 Pd wt%) at a constant flow rate of ca. 0.12 mL min−1, together with a constant H2 flow rate of ca. 0.5 mL min−1 at room temperature, while the hydrogen gas was released at atmospheric pressure at the outlet of the reactor. For cyclooctadiene the substrate solution flow rate was varied between 0.05 and 0.25 mL min−1 and the H2 flow rate between 0.3 and 0.55 mL min−1. This resulted in a H2 pressure at the reactor inlet between 2.2 and 2.4 bars corresponding to a molar ratio 2.2 < H2/cyclooctadiene < 4.5. For 3-hexyn-1-ol the substrate solution flow rate was varied between 0.05 and 0.25 mL min−1 and the H2 flow rate between 0.2 and 1.3 mL min−1. This resulted in a H2 pressure at the reactor inlet between 2.4 and 3.1 bar corresponding to a molar ratio 0.6 < H2/hexynol < 2.5. Therefore, the pressure drops gen- erated by monolithic reactors were between 1 and 2 bars. The attainment of the steady state conditions (ca. 1–3 h) was taken as the reaction start time. The product solution was period- ically analyzed for conversion by GC, while 7.2 mL h−1 aliquots were continuously sampled for subsequent Pd leaching analysis. The content of palladium leached in the catalysis solutions was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emis- sion Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) with a Varian 720ES instrument at a sensitivity of 500 ppb. Each sample (7.2 mL) was treated in a microwave-heated digestion bomb (Milestone, MLS-200) with concentrated HNO3 (1.5 mL), 98% H2SO4 (2 mL), 37% HCl (0.5 mL) and a pellet of a digestion aid reagent (0.5 g, 0.1% Se in K2SO4).

They have also shown that too small meso- pores (<10 nm) restrict mass diﬀusion. The productivity in fine chemicals transformations was increased by using higher flow rates until the point where contact times were not enough to ensure high conversion.10,11 Previously we have shown that these new kinds of pore-flow-through silica monolith micro- reactors induced high productivity and high stability for base and acid catalyzed reactions of fine chemicals in the liquid phase under continuous flow.3b,8,10 The superiority of this new kind of monolith, used as a single piece microreactor, was demonstrated by the higher conversions and productivities achieved compared to packed-bed or batch reactors filled with crushed monolith.8,10 This result is most probably due to the more uniform contact time arising for the homogeneity of the macroporous network in the single piece monolith in compa- rison to the dual macroporosity (interand intra-particle) encountered in a packed-bed system. In the present study, we analyze the eﬀectiveness of these promising pore-flow-through silica monolith microreactors in a triphasic liquid/gas/solid system for selective hydrogenation reactions under conditions allowing a fine control of gas and liquid contact times on Pd nanoparticles (NPs) catalytic sites immobilized onto the silica network. Diﬀerent groups have reported on the catalytic behavior of Pd NPs supported on polymeric matrixes, dendrimers, zeolites and dispersed silica in selective hydrogenation.15 Selective hydrogenation of hydrocarbons with multiple CvC and/or CuC and/or CvO bonds to achieve selective hydrogenation products (e.g. monoalkenes) is a highly desired and challen- ging process in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and petro- chemical industry sectors.16 Under comparable conditions, hydrogenation rates roughly followed the order CuC > CvC > CvO. This behavior can be justified in terms of greater aﬃnity of Pd for CvC than for CvO bonds in aliphatic compounds.17\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Higher selectivity in alkene products was achieved, up to 80%, by increasing substrate flow rate at a constant H2/substrate molar ratio with a minimal decrease of the conversion (72%) (Fig. 8). An increase in the solution flow rate (i.e. a decrease of the resi- dence time from 420 to 140 s while keeping a constant H2/sub- strate molar ratio) invariably led to an increase in partial hydrogenation. For a constant conversion, the cis-selectivity remains constant over time. The best conversion and selectiv- ity in cis-3-hexen-1-ol was achieved at a H2 flow rate of 0.7 mL min−1 and a substrate flow rate of 0.15 mL min−1 and gives a productivity of 9.6 mmol s−1 g−1 MonoSil or 0.75 mol s−1 g−1 Pd. Although the performances in terms of product selectivity stand below those of the Lindlar catalyst these preliminary results highlight the high potential and the flexibility of the Pd-MonoSil operated in continuous flow for a rather complex selective hydrogenation reaction. Pd-MonoSil can be used under flow conditions, with enormous benefits from an indus- trial point of view in terms of long-term productivity and space-to-time yield (STY): e.g. for 3-hexyn-1-ol hydrogenation, the STY (calculated from ref. 20e) of the Lindlar catalyst is 26 g l−1 h−1 vs. 270 g l−1 h−1 for Pd-MonoSil. Furthermore, the increase of selectivity with time on stream with Pd-MonoSil suggests some negative influence of surface sites (silanol groups), which can be amended by passivation treatments. The eﬀect of green additives can be readily investigated.

The reactor was completely inert, as all wet parts were made of PEEK (poly- ether ether ketone), PFA (perfluoroalkoxy) or PTFE (polytetra- fluoroethylene). The flow of the substrate solution was regulated by an Alltech® model 426 HPLC pump in PEEK. A constant flow of hydrogen gas was adjusted by a flow controller BRONKHORST HI-TEC model F200CV-002-RGD-11-V-MFC. The hydrogen pressure in the reactor was monitored by a BRONKHORST HI-TEC P502C-AGD-11-V-6K0R-EPC meter.

In both reactions, the catalytic microreactor demonstrates remarkable stability of the activity with time on stream. The substrate conversion level as well as the selectivity into the target product can be readily controlled by indepen- dently adjusting the hydrogen and substrate flow rates. In the selective hydrogenation of 1,5-cyclooctadiene, a conversion of 95% and a selectivity of 90% in monohydrogenated product, constant over a period of 70 h, have been reached. These figures correspond to a productivity of 4.2 mmol s−1 g−1 MonoSil (or 0.32 mol s−1 g−1 Pd) and compare well with benchmark membrane based catalysts. In the stereoselective hydrogen- ation of 3-hexyn-1-ol a constant conversion of 85% and a selec- tivity of 80% into the cis isomer have been obtained over a period of 7 h, corresponding to a 10 times higher productivity in comparison to batch using the Lindlar catalyst. The versati- lity and flexibility of the monolithic microreactor in triphasic systems have been demonstrated and open new perspectives for the implementation of fine chemicals synthesis in continu- ous flow mode.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

No Pd leaching was evidenced by ICP-OES analysis of the solutions. Pd-MonoSil-3 was used as a catalyst in the hydrogenation under continuous flow at room temperature and low H2 pressure (2–3 bars) of 1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD) and 3-hexyn- 1-ol using methanol as a solvent (Scheme 1). The eﬃciency of Pd-MonoSil-3 (1.3 Pd wt%) was first tested for the selective hydrogenation of COD in cyclooctene (COE). As shown in Fig. 5, under the test conditions a constant con- version of 95% and a constant selectivity in COE of 90% were obtained after ca. 2 hours and a half under flow. The conver- sion and the selectivity are controlled by tuning H2 and sub- strate flow rates (Fig. 6).
