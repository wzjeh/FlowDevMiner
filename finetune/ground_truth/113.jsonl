The internal volume of the microchannel is 30 mL with 10 channel units. The residence time was changed by varying the number of plates. The flow rate of the target reaction layer is 0−100 mL/min, and the operating temperature and pressure are −30 to 200 °C and 0−20 bar, respectively. The model with a precise high-pressure pump is Sanotac-MPF0502C. The cooling circulation system is supplied by the refrigerated/ heated circulation unit (GDSZ-50L/−30 °C, Zhengzhou Ruihan Instrument Co., Ltd., China). The reaction temper- ature was monitored and recorded using a multichannel temperature logger. For accurate acquisition of reaction temperature data, temperature sensors are evenly distributed in the microreactor channels. The experimental setup is shown in Figure 1. 2.3. Experimental Procedures. Before starting the flow process, the flow rate of the plunger pump must be calibrated to provide an accurate flow rate. The channel must be cleaned with a dichloromethane solution to ensure that it contains no impurities. The experimental configuration for 2-ethylhexyl nitrate synthesis is illustrated in Figure 1. 2-Ethyl-1-hexanol (23.8 mL/min, 3.044 mol·L−1·min−1) and HNO3/H2SO4 mixed acid (26.2 mL/min, 3.96 mol·L−1·min−1) were introduced to the microchannel by plunger pumps, at a temperature of 15 °C, a total flow rate of 50 mL/min, and a residence time of 20 s. The residence time was controlled by changing the number of the channel plates. The reaction was quenched with ice water at the end of the response. The acid in the organic phase was neutralized with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and finally, the organic phase was washed with water until it was neutral. The liquid sample was collected from the organic phase. 2-Ethylhexyl nitrate had a purity of more than 99.6% through high-performance gas chromatog- raphy. 2.4. Materials. 2-Ethyl-1-hexanol (99.5% purity) was purchased from NanJing JuYou Technology Co., Ltd., China. Sulfuric acid (98 wt %) and fuming nitric acid (95 wt %) were purchased from NanJing University Science and Technology, China. Dichloromethane and ethanol were purchased from NanJing JuYou Technology Co., Ltd., China. All chemicals were used without further purification. 2.5. Sample Analysis. When the microreactor system is in a stable continuous reaction state, the sample is collected directly at the reactor outlet and quenched in ice water. The organic layer was removed with dichloromethane, neutralized with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, and diluted neutrally.

Results showed an excellent mixed eﬀect with a flow rate range of 10 mL/min to 80 mL/min. The path lines of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol/mixed acid show that the total flow rate starts from 30 mL/min between the two obstacles within the heart-shaped reactor generating recirculation zones. Compared with the traditional batch reactor, the excellent mixing eﬀect of the microreactor breaks the mass transfer resistance, and the heat generated by the nitration reaction can be evenly distributed, eﬀectively reducing the generation of side reactions. Encouraged by laboratory-scale results, we directly scaled up the size of the microreactor and performed reaction experi- ments under the same conditions. With these results, the scale- up equipment has also been demonstrated to successfully conduct a kilogram-scale synthesis of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate. This study provides a rapid and straightforward method for the continuous synthesis of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate for kilogram-scale with a high yield and high selectivity and provides an essential model for the kilogram-scale synthesis nitration reaction of alcohol. ■ AUTHOR INFORMATION\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Using Box−Behnken experimental design, the eﬀects of process parameters such as temperature, molar ratio, total flow rate, and mass fraction of sulfuric acid on the yield of the target product were systematically investigated. The experimental design was studied at four factors and three levels. The results revealed that the sulfuric acid mass fraction and temperature significantly aﬀected the yield of the product. There was a good agreement between the experimental results and predicted results by the proposed regression model. Subsequently, the mixing eﬀect of the liquid−liquid heterogeneous system in microreactor was simulated by using computational fluid dynamics. The results provide solid evidence that the microreactor has excellent mixing eﬃciency in mass and heat transfer compared with the conventional reactor. Consequently, based on the results of process parameter optimization, an enlarged microreactor was designed to intensify the preparation of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate by a throughput of 16 kg/h.

The simulation data show that the model is standard. 3.2. Experimental Factor Analysis. The response surface is a three-dimensional surface graph composed of response value and design experimental factors, which can intuitively reflect the influence of various experimental factors and the influence of their interaction on the response value to obtain the optimal process parameters. Export-Design 8.0.6 software was used to design and draw a three-dimensional surface diagram of the eﬀect of two-factor interaction on product yield, as shown in Figure 4. When the other two factors are constant values, the degree of interaction between the two factors is diﬀerent, and the value of the product performance response is not linear. 3.3. Eﬀect of Reaction Temperature. As we all know, the nitration reaction is a highly exothermic reaction, which is likely to cause the decomposition of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate and nitric acid at the high reaction temperatures. Intrinsic reaction kinetics have a stronger dependence on temperature than mass transfer. If the reaction process cannot be eﬀectively controlled, an excessively high reaction temperature will cause an explosion. Therefore, the temperature is the main factor influencing the nitration reaction. It can be seen in Figure 4a, when the mass fraction of sulfuric acid is 90.5%, and the total flow rate is 50 mL/min, that the yield of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate increases with increasing temperature. Increasing reaction temperature can speed up the reaction rate and promote the conversion of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. According to Figure 4b and c, the increase of reaction temperature is conducive to increasing product yield. Due to the large specific surface of the microreactor, it is beneficial for mass and heat transfer. The nitrification reaction releases a large amount of heat, which facilitates even heat distribution, avoids side reactions caused by local overheating of the tank reactor, and thus increases the output. 3.4. Eﬀect of Molar Ratio. The material molar ratio promotes the conversion of the reaction and improves the selectivity of the target product and simplifies the postprocess- ing procedures and reduces waste. It can be clearly seen from Figure 4e that when the reaction temperature is 10 °C, the total flow rate is 50 mL/min. The molar ratio response surface of the materials presents a curved shape. As the molar ratio increases, the yield of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate tends to increase first and then decrease.

The main reason is that excessive nitric acid easily causes the side reaction of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol to oxidize to isooctane. The yield of product decreases as the molar ratio of nitric acid increases. Therefore, it is vital to choose the best molar ratio to increase the product yield. 3.5. Eﬀect of Flow Rate. The flow rate is an essential parameter for the nitration reaction in the microreactor. According to the reaction mechanism, the synthesis of 2- ethylhexyl nitrate is a heterogeneous liquid−liquid reaction. The heterogeneous liquid−liquid response is controlled by mass transfer in a conventional batch reactor, and the stirring eﬀect is the primary means to break the mass transfer resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to study the influence of the mixing eﬀect of the reaction in the microreactor. In a microreactor, changing the flow rate is the most common method to improve mixing eﬃciency. It can be seen from Figure 4f that when the temperature is 10 °C, and the molar ratio is 1.2, the yield of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate does not increase significantly with the increase of the flow rate. It can be seen from Figure 4b and d that the flow rate has almost no eﬀect on the product yield. It may be due to the small size and large specific surface area of the microreactor, which promotes two- phase diﬀusion and improves the mass transfer eﬃciency. Therefore, to verify this conjecture, this work uses computa- tional fluid dynamics software to simulate the mass transfer and mixing eﬃciency of the microreactor.31−33\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
