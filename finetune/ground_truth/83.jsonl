The maximal yield of 5-ATHIN is obtained with a gas flow rate of 30 sccm.

The samples using stale catalysts at the reaction conditions (temperature: 60 °C, hydrogen pressure: 2.0 MPa, liquid flow rate: 0.3 mL/min, and gas flow rate: 20 sccm) were analyzed and compared with the values obtained with fresh catalysts at the same conditions. If the yield of the main product decreased by more than 3%, the stale catalysts would be replaced by fresh catalysts. Besides, the stale catalysts were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) to determine the reason for deactivation, and the results are shown inSection 2 in the Supporting Information, indicating obvious metal leaching.

Finally, a mixture of N2 and the solvent was transported into the system to fully remove the residual gas−liquid mixture, and the catalysts were stored in a nitrogen atmosphere. Analytical Method. The samples were collected directly from the outlet of the continuous system.

Hence, a temperature of 60 °C was selected for the synthesis of 5-AIN in the following experiments. Figure 4b illustrates that the selectivity of 5-ATHIN gradually increases to a high value of 98.6% at 80 °C, while the selectivity of 5-AIN continuously decreases to 0%, revealing that the high temperature accelerates the reduction of the pyridine ring with the Pd/ Al2O3 catalyst. Additionally, negligible variation of 5-APHIN is observed at diﬀerent temperatures, indicating the diﬃculty for the reduction of the benzene ring even with the high-activity 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. AZO is not detected in the products, indicating the remarkable performance of Ni/SiO2 on the suppression of azoxy compounds. For the consideration of the maximal yield of 5-ATHIN, a temperature of 80 °C was chosen for the following experiments. Eﬀect of the Liquid Flow Rate. The variation of the liquid flow rate would change the residence time, which significantly influences reaction performance and product composition. For hydrogenation under shorter residence times, the reactant 5-NTIN could not be transformed into 5- AIN or 5-ATHIN completely, as part of the reactant flows out of the reactor before coming in contact with hydrogen on the catalysts, while for hydrogenation under longer residence times, it is inevitable for 5-ATHIN to be further reduced to 5- APHIN. Hence, it is important to determine a proper liquid flow rate for the selective hydrogenation of 5-AIN and 5- ATHIN to improve the reaction performance and obtain maximal yields of 5-AIN and 5-ATHIN. As shown in Figure 5a, the conversion of 5-NTIN is below 99% when the liquid flow rate is higher than 0.3 mL/min and continuously decreases to 91.3% with a liquid flow rate of 0.45 mL/min, which could be attributed to the insuﬃcient residence time at a high liquid flow rate. Meanwhile, the selectivity of 5-AIN is approaching 100% for flow rates ranging from 0.2 to 0.45 mL/min. Hence, a liquid flow rate of 0.3 mL/ min was selected for the following experiments.

The solution was premixed with hydrogen from the regulated cylinder prior to entering the reactor. A check valve was placed upstream of the reactor to prevent the backflow from damaging the mass flow controller. The reactor and two coils were immersed horizontally in the water bath to control the reaction temperature.41 The system pressure was controlled by the backpressure regulator, and two pressure transducers were installed upstream and downstream of the micropacked bed reactor for the online monitoring of pressure drop. System parameters (liquid flow rate and gas flow rate) were both controlled using online control software on the computer.

Based on the results obtained from Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/C catalysts, it can be concluded that the Pt/C catalyst is not suitable for the synthesis of 5-ATHIN due to low activity, while the inhibition for the formation of AZO using the Pd/ Al2O3 catalyst is highly required, although it exhibits excellent activity for the hydrogenation of 5-AIN. As shown in Scheme 1, the presence of the nitro group is the essential part for the formation of AZO, which indicates that the reduction of the nitro group using another catalyst prior to the hydrogenation of pyridine using the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst may obtain satisfying results. Therefore, two-stage micropacked bed reactors were developed for the continuous synthesis of 5-ATHIN. Since high purity of 5-AIN without any AZO could be obtained using the Ni/SiO2 catalyst, a micropacked bed filled with the Ni/SiO2 catalyst (length: 18 cm, inner diameter: 4.57 mm) was placed upstream of the reactor packed with Pd/Al2O3 for the synthesis of 5-ATHIN, which means two consecutive packed beds with diﬀerent catalysts were adopted for the highly selective synthesis of 5-ATHIN. For the optimization of the synthesis of 5-AIN and 5- ATHIN, the eﬀect of reaction parameters on the reactor performance was investigated by comparing the conversion and selectivity of 5-AIN and 5-ATHIN in products under diﬀerent reaction parameters. For the synthesis of 5-AIN, a one-stage reactor packed with the Ni/SiO2 catalyst was employed, while utilizing two-stage micropacked bed reactors packed with Ni/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts for the synthesis of 5-ATHIN. Eﬀect of the Gas Flow Rate. In the continuous hydrogenation process, the hydrogen flow rate may reduce the residence time and intensify the gas−liquid mass transfer by increasing the turbulence, which significantly influences the conversion and selectivity of the reaction.57 To determine the eﬀect of the gas flow rate on the synthesis of 5-AIN and 5- ATHIN, the experiments under diﬀerent gas flow rates were conducted, and the results are shown in Figure 2.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

However, high selectivity is diﬃcult to achieve in conventional batch reactors owing to severe back mixing and poor mass transfer performance, resulting in the high requirement for subsequent separation processes. In this work, a continuous flow system based on a micropacked bed reactor is developed for the selective hydrogenation of heterocyclic nitroaromatics and the reductions of 5-nitroisoquinoline to 5-aminoisoquinoline and 5-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline are selected as the model reactions. With the optimal reaction conditions, maximal yields of 99.9% (5-aminoisoquinoline) and 99.3% (5- amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline) are obtained successfully. Moreover, this system exhibits remarkable performance for the selective hydrogenation of relevant heterocyclic nitroaromatics with all yields beyond the level of 97.5%. The continuous flow system enables eﬃcient hydrogenation of heterocyclic nitroaromatics and remarkable selectivity of target products with shorter reaction time and safer operation compared with batch reactors.
