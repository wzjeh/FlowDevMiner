Therefore, it was considered that the condensation route was the main route of the reaction, in which azoxy hydrogenation was the rate- controlling step. Furthermore, the primary amine may continue to convert to aniline by overreaction. To investigate the feasibility of industrial applications, the condition of substrate concentration was further studied. When the concentration was 0.375 M (Table 4, Entry 2), the conver- sion can reach >99.9% with the space time yield (STY) of 588 g¢L¹1¢h¹1, but the selectivity slightly declined. When the concentration increased (Table 4, Entries 3­4), the substrate presented in the GC spectra of the product, and the conversion and selectivity decreased significantly. STY was proportional to the concentration, so the STY value was able to be maintained at a higher value at 1.13 M than that at 0.375 M in spite of the fact that the conversion became lower. In the above experiments, high catalytic activity and conversion were obtained in most cases. To further investigate the stability of the catalyst and the continuous flow system for long-time operation, continuous operation was performed under the conditions of 1 mL/min flow rate, 0.375 M 4-TFMNB, 60 sccm hydrogen flow rate, hydrogen pressure of 2 MPa and reaction temperature of 60 °C. From Figure 6, the catalysts exhibited high and stable catalytic activity with no substrate identified in product solution under a 20-h continuous operation. The flow hydrogenation conducted for 20 h provided 1200 mL of the solution of product (0.375 M, 77.6 g).\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The results on mean residence time are shown in Table 3 and Figure 4. Detailed experimental methods and further explanations are provided in the Support Information. It was demonstrated that both liquid flow rate and gas flow rate had a certain degree of eﬀect on the residence time, and liquid flow rate was considered as the dominant factor. Under the condition of constant gas flow rate, the increase of liquid flow rate led to a decrease in residence time and relative inadequate hydrogen gas resulting in the incompleteness of reaction. With constant liquid flow rate, selectivity increased with the increase of gas flow rate, which might due to the addition of hydrogen despite the decrease in the residence time of gas flow rate. At the same ratio of gas to liquid rate, selectivity decreased with the increase of liquid flow rate, which was due to the decrease in the residence time. The types and chemical structures of intermediates in the product were identified by GC-MS. The GC-MS spectra are provided in the Support Information. Azoxy and azo compounds were clearly identified in the GC-MS spectra, but no significant nitroso or hydroxylamine compounds were observed. It was indicated that the intermediates of this reaction were mainly azoxy and azo compounds. In addition, a small amount of aniline was observed. A mechanism of the reaction is proposed in Figure 5. Starting from the aromatic nitro compound, reduc- tion reactions were required to get the corresponding aniline, which could be achieved via two routes: the direct route or the condensation route.8,19,24 In the direct route, two steps of sequential fast hydrogenations of the nitro compounds to the nitroso and hydroxylamine compounds would occur before undergoing the slow eventual reduction to the primary amine.

The flow hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes eﬃciently proceeded within 31 s to give the corresponding anilines, respectively, in excellent yields with good eﬃciency and chemoselectivity. Moreover, the long-term continuous-flow hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes was realized, and without significant loss of catalytic activity.20\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Typically, the nitration product 4-TFMNB obtained in industry inevitably contains a certain number of 2-TFMNB isomers. With the concern of feasibility and safety issues, the nitro compounds are generally separated through distillation after hydrogenation in industry. Because of the presence of isomers in the raw materials, the catalytic hydrogenation could be evaluated by comparing the conversion and selectivity of nitro in the raw materials. In the batch process, the problem focuses on the low selectivity and long reaction time when conducting the hydrogenation reaction. Additionally, long reaction time is unfavored because of the incidence of side eﬀects. In the past decade, continuous flow chemistry has attracted great interests in the field of catalytic hydrogenation because of its advantages of greenness and safety in process intensifica- tion.4­7 Consequently, a series of new reactors and devices have been developed, such as micropacked-bed reactors (¯PBR),8­11\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The solvents suitable for the reaction were screened, and the eﬀects of gas flow rates, liquid flow rates and their concen- trations were investigated. The objective was to establish a trusted method of continuous production of 4-TFMA with high eﬃciency. Bead-shaped activated carbon (BAC) is a highly spherical activated carbon made from petroleum pitch. Its excellent adsorption capacity, strength and flowability enables wide- ranging uses, especially in catalyst support.21,22 In ¯PBR, BAC would produce a low pressure drop that would make the reactor operation feasible.22 A commercial BAC produced by Kureha Co., Ltd., was used as the support in this study. The range of BAC diameter was 0.60­0.84 mm (0.70 mm in average). Pt/BAC catalyst was prepared using an impregnation method. The catalysts used for ¯PBR were firstly characterized. A TEM image of the Pt/BAC catalyst is shown in Figure 2. It was observed that metal particles with relatively uniform particle size evenly dispersed at the surface of Pt/BAC catalyst. From the size distribution of Pt nanoparticles, the average particle size of Pt nanoparticles was determined to be about 5.3 nm. CO chemisorption and N2 physisorption were conducted to further characterize the catalyst. A summary of detailed physical properties of Pt/BAC catalyst is listed in Table 1.
