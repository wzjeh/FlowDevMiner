Due to the short molecular diffusion path in the microreactor, the fluid flow is laminar, where fluid mixing depends primarily on the channel configuration and flow velocity (Xu et al., 2023). In order to achieve the ideal mixing effect toward fully understanding of reaction kinetics and developing a more accurate reaction model, the influences of different flow velocities on the conversion of ST under the same residence time were studied, as shown in Fig. 2. It could be found that at low flow rates, the styrene conversion rate rises almost linearly with increasing flow velocity, indicating that the reaction kinetics are controlled by mass transfer. However, when the flow rate exceeds 0.25 mL/min, the styrene conversion rate would not increase further and remains nearly un- changed, implying that the reaction mixture has been sufficiently mixed. The reaction flow rate should be large enough to ensure an ideal mixture of tests under all experimental conditions. Consequently, the flow ve- locity of the reaction mixture was maintained at 0.3 mL/min for the subsequent experiments.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

However, conventional batch reactor usually suffers from poor mass transfer and long reaction times. Comparatively, microreactors offer substantial improvement in mass and heat transfer for high-efficient production. Especially, it could innovate the original batch operation mode into continuous production. In this work, a highly efficient continuous flow system is constructed for styrene difluoroalkylation using CuI as a catalyst and BrCF2CO2Et as fluorinating re- agent. The influences of reactant ratios, catalyst content, alkali amount, reaction temperature and residence time on reaction performance were investigated systematically. Under optimal conditions, 80% yield was gained in only 0.5 h. The reaction time required is significantly shortened. Meanwhile, the usage of catalyst could also be reduced. Moreover, the kinetics of the styrene difluoroalkylation reaction in microreactor were studied, and the rate constant, activation energy and pre-exponential factor were obtained according to reaction kinetic model.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

With the increase of molar amount of EBFA, styrene is progressively transformed, accordingly leading to an increase in product yield. It was found that the optimal yield is achieved when the molar ratio of EBFA to ST reaches 1.5. Beyond this ratio, further increasing molar ratio would not significantly affect the yield, which becomes nearly leveled off, the selectivity of the reaction would also remain almost unchanged. This could be attributed to the reaction kinetics, as the maximum frequency of collisions between reactant molecules has been reached. Accordingly, the subsequent experiments were conducted with the molar ratio of EBFA to ST as 1.5.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Lai et al.(Lai et al., 2017) use a batch reactor and conduct a reaction under N2 protection at 60 ◦C for 46 h, and the target product was obtained only with a 45 % yield. Similarly, under an argon atmosphere, Wang et al.(Wang et al., 2017) conducted the reaction at 80 ◦C for 12 h, affording a 77 % yield. On the contrary, in the absence of inert gas protection, the desired product was observed with a yield of 65 % after 24 h at 80 ◦C condition in the study of Zhang et al(Zhang et al., 2015). In this experiment, the yield after 12 h in the reaction tube at 85 ◦C was only 34 %. Compared to batch reactor, microreactor offers the advantages of closed systems and internal sta- bility, making them less susceptible to intrusion by media such as water and air. This effectively eliminates the impact of oxygen on free radical reactions. Therefore, the reaction in microreactor has no requirement for inert gas protection, which reduces catalyst usage and shortens residence time.
