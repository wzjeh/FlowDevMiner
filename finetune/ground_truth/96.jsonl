At the same flow rate, the longer the residence time, the more microreactor plates are required, increasing the manufacturing cost. Figure 12 represents the variation of residence time in the first nitrifi- cation reaction by increasing the number of reactor plates. The first microreactor was selected with 4, 6, and 10 plates, and the number of plates in the second microreactor was not changed. There was a slight increase in the mono- nitro products and poly-nitro impurities yields, increasing the residence time. Figure 13 shows the effect of varying the residence time of the second segment on the reaction. Since the second microreactor designed only four plates, we chose to take samples in the second reactor plates for com- parison. The experimental results show that there has 1.4% m-xylene unconverted. Therefore, the above experimental results show that the optimal total residence time is 104 s. Figure 14 analyzes the relationship between conversion rate and residence time for the two-step nitration method. It can be seen that the conversion rate has a positive proportional relationship with the residence time. As the residence time increases, the conversion rate gradually decreases because the water produced by the reaction reduces the nitration capacity. The conversion rate of 90% HNO3 is significantly lower than that of 98% HNO3, demonstrating the effect of water on the nitration reaction. However, the addition of H2SO4 increased the conversion from 69.2 to 99.5%.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

It is widely used in chemical synthesis. Most successfully, using microreactor technology for rapid reactions with mixing or transport limitations can improve reaction performance, such as nitration [27–29].

The yields of the orthoand meta-isomers products can reach 42% and 96%, respectively, which is impossible in a batch reactor. Xie [31] reported a method for synthesizing kilo- gram-scale piperacillin in a microreactor. The micro-flow system consists of two membrane dispersion microreactors connected in series. By varying the size and cross-sectional area of the membranes, yields of 94.70% and purity exceed- ing 99.7% were obtained.

In the micro- reactor, the yield of 1-methyl-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzene with mixed acids reached 98% within a residence time of 5 s. Sharma et al. [33] studied the reactions of different nitri- fiers to o-xylene in microreactors and discussed the eco- nomic feasibility.

However, in the microreactor, T and C vary along the reac- tor channel, which means they are dependent on the loca- tion, namely r = f(z) [47]. The batch operation can control the reaction time and reduce the exothermic rate of the reaction by adding the material slowly to the batch reactor. However, the heat release rate of reaction in the microreac- tor is a function of space, and the heat release of reaction is mainly concentrated in the front of microchannel plates. Therefore, by controlling the heat removal rate of the front reaction module or reducing nitration capacity, the heat release rate of the reaction can be promoted smoothly. For industrial-scale amplification, increasing the heat removal rate of coolant requires high energy consumption, and the heat transfer area can not be infinitely amplified. Based on this, we designed a method to reduce the nitration capacity of the nitration agent and reduce the heat release rate of the reaction.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The main ways to avoid thermal runaway include reducing the exothermic reaction rate and increasing the coolant heat removal rate. In general, poly-nitro products require very high temperatures. A high sulfuric acid strength favors conversion rate but degrades selectivity. As shown in Figure 7, at the same temperature, the content of poly-nitro products when the mass fraction of sulfuric acid reaches 90% is 11 times that when the mass fraction comes to 70%. The concentrations of reactants were high at the beginning, leading to a fast reaction rate and high heat generation rate. In the case of speedy and strongly exothermic reactions, even the superior heat transfer characteristics of the micro- reactor may not be sufficient to avoid hot spots in the inlet region of the reactor, and side reactions may still occur.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
