The CAN and CNB at hydrogen flow rate with 22.5 sccm were slightly higher than other results. The results could be attributed to the longer residence time of liquids in the reactor due to the small gas flow rate. Therefore, gas flow rate of 25 sccm was selected for the following experiments.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

And the variation of residence time has significant influence on the dechlorination process and the generation of AZO. For the hydrogenation under long resi- dence time, dechlorination would inevitably appear since target product 3,4-DCAN remaining on the Pt/C catalyst was dehalogenated by the hydrogen absorbed on the catalyst surface. While for the reaction under short residence time, it wasn't sufficient for the 3,4-DCNB and AZO to contact with hydrogen, therefore, they cannot be converted to the desired product. Figure 5 has shown that when the liquid flow rate varied from 0.4 mL/min to 0.7 mL/min which corresponds to the residence time from 2.2 min to 3.8 min, the yields of 3,4- DCAN were all beyond 99.5% and no AZO was observed in GC. As the liquid flow rate was increased, AZO was generated owing to the shorter residence time to be further reduced to 3,4-DCAN and the yield of 3,4-DCAN declined to 99.3%. In Fig. 6, it was found that maximal yield of 3,4- DCAN appeared under higher liquid flow rate as the temper- ature increased, indicating that side reaction (dehalogenation and condensation) was accelerated at higher temperature, hence decreasing residence time would diminish the adverse impact.

Todor et al. [22] proposed a continuous flow system with new Co3O4/NGr@CNT as catalysts in a micropacked bed reactor for the reduction of 4-iodonitrobenzene. The results showed that main prod- uct (4-iodoaniline) was obtained without any detectable dehalogenation at full conversion, which proved the effec- tiveness of continuous-flow micropacked bed system on the highly selective hydrogenation of halogenated aromatics. Feng et al. [23] adopted continuous-flow technology for the hydrogenation of crizotinib intermediate using Raney Ni as the catalyst. Consequently, side reactions such as dehalo- genation and debenzylation were inhibited eminently and desired product was obtained with high selectivity (99.9%) and high conversion (99.5%). Hannes et al. [24] selected the hydrogenation of 1-iodo-4-nitrobenzene as the model reac- tion and evaluated reaction performance under batch and continuous flow modes. Experimental results indicated that the yield of 4-iodoaniline in continuous flow system were 10% higher than that in batch reactor, verifying the supe- riority of continuous flow for the selective hydrogenation of halogenated aromatics. Therefore, the continuous flow system based on micropacked bed reactor would offer excel- lent mixing efficiency and great control over residence time and temperature, improving reaction selectivity remarkably and minimizing excessive hydrogenation which results in undesired dehalogenation. The hydrogenation of 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene (3,4- DCNB) was selected as the model reaction and the product 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCAN) is a significant intermedi- ate in dye and pigment industry [25, 26].

The reason may be that higher hydrogen pres- sure increases the amount of active hydrogen on the cata- lyst which accelerates the reduction of nitro group while the reaction rate of dehalogenation is irrelevant with the hydrogen pressure as pressure higher than 1.0 MPa [30, 39]. The yields of the hydrogenation at different pressures were shown in Fig. 3. The maximal yield of 3,4-DCAN (99.8%) was obtained with the pressure of 2.0 MPa. Hence, the pres- sure of 2.0 MPa was selected as the optimized condition for the following experiments.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

This difference may be attributed to the mutual position of Cl atom and nitro group in the benzene ring. While for 4-chloro-2-nitroanisole and 5-chloro-2-nitroanisole, these two substances were more prone to dechlorinate, hence the reaction temperature was adjusted to 50 ℃ except for the adjustment of pressure. And due to the low solubility of 4-chloro-2-nitroanisole in methanol, the concentration was also altered to 5 wt%. The yields of corresponding aniline were all at the level of 99.5%, verifying the efficiency and applicability of H-flow system for the selective hydrogenation of chroniated nitro compounds.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

However, the hydrogenation reactions in commonly utilized batch reactors suffer from the undesired dehalogenation, result- ing in higher requirement for subsequent separation processes and severe corrosion to industrial fatalities. In this work, a H-flow system with the micropacked bed reactor was developed for the selective hydrogenation of halogenated nitroaromatic compounds and the reduction of 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene was selected as the model reaction. With the optimal hydrogena- tion conditions, the yield of 3,4-dichloroaniline was obtained as high as 99.8% under mild conditions. With this strategy this flow system was successfully employed to the reduction of other chlorinated nitroaromatics also demonstrating low dehalogenation. The H-flow system enables negligible dehalogenation and remarkable yield of target product with higher efficiency and lower energy cost compared with the batch reactor.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
