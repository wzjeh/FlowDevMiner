The mixing process during the polymer- ization in the capillary microreactor was analyzed according to the flow characteristics. A higher flow rate was beneficial for improving the mixing between the initiators and the mono- mers and thus the polymerization rate. A higher temperature was also found to improve the mixing performance and the monomer conversion in the polymerization. However, higher polymerization temperatures led to lower values of Mn and larger values of PDI. The measurement on the viscosity of the reaction mixture with different monomer conversions at vari- ous temperatures was conducted. The viscosity of the reaction mixture significantly increased with the increase of the mono- mer conversion. Nevertheless, the reaction mixture in the capillary microreactor during the polymerization still belonged to the Newtonian fluid because of the low molecular weight of the produced poly(acrylamide). Both diffusion coefficients of the monomers and the polymers were correlated with the monomer conversion, the viscosity of the reaction mixture during the polymerization. With the diffusion coefficients of the monomers and the polymers in hand, the average charac- teristic mixing time in the capillary microreactor during the polymerization was further deduced with considering the mutual effects of the transports of monomers, monomer radi- cals, and polymers. The monomer conversion of 87.0% could be obtained with the capillary length of 15 m at the residence time of 12 min and the reaction temperature of 508C. How- ever, the produced polymers and the residual monomers still could not achieve homogenous mixing in the capillary micro- reactor according to the calculation of the characteristic mix- ing time. The monomer conversion was improved with the increase of the capillary diameter. A heat balance for the polymeriza- tion in the capillary microreactor was analyzed to explain the effect of the capillary diameter on the polymerization perfor- mance. The radial temperature heterogeneity became higher and more hot spots existed inside the capillary microreactor with a larger inner diameter, leading to a higher monomer con- version. Moreover, the flow profile estimation indicated that the deviations from plug flow increased with enlarging the capillary diameter and with the polymerization proceeding according to the calculation of the Bodenstein number. The dispersion effect indicated by the Taylor dispersion coefficient aggravated the inhomogeneity of the reaction condition in capillary microreactors, which was more significant in the microreactor with a larger inner diameter. Thus, poly(acryl- amide) synthesized in the capillary microreactor with a smaller inner diameter led to larger values of Mn and lower values of PDI than those in the capillary microreactor with a\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) and sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) composed the redox initiator for this polymerization. The mixing characteristics associated with this polymerization in the capillary microreactors were analyzed. Various factors such as volumetric flow rate, resi- dence time, reaction temperature, viscosity, capillary diameter and operational mode, which affect the reaction kinetics or the mixing efficiency and thus the polymerization in the capillary microreactor were investigated systematically. The polymeri- zation performance was evaluated in terms of the monomer conversion (X), the number-average molecular weight of poly- mers and the polydispersity index of molecular weight distri- bution. The variation of reaction mixture viscosity with the conversion and its influences on the diffusion coefficients of monomers and polymers, and on the mixing performance in the capillary microreactor were characterized in details. The characteristic mixing time in the capillary microreactor was deduced with considering the effects of the viscosity variation and the produced polymers during the polymerization. A heat balance calculation for the polymerization in the capillary microreactor was conducted and the dispersion effect was evaluated to elaborate the effect of capillary diameter on the polymerization performance. Furthermore, a premixing stage as an alternative operational mode was added into the micro- reactor system to achieve optimized conditions with low val- ues of PDI for the polymerization.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

It was claimed that the efficient mixing in microreactors was utilized to synthesize polymers to control the product properties such as Mn and PDI in all these studies. However, the mixing performance in the polymerization processes in microreactors was not evaluated systematically even it would be typically affected by a number of factors such as fluid properties, reactor structures, and operational conditions. In fact, the mixing process in the polymerization is much more complicated than that in small-molecule reaction systems due to the heterogeneity of monomers, radicals and polymer chains and the significant variation of fluid properties (e.g., viscosity) during the polymerization. The mixing will play a crucial role in the reaction processes when the characteristic timescale of the chemical reactions involved is of the same magnitude or smaller than the time- scale of the mixing process.21 In fact, the effect of mixing on the reaction processes can be judged by various dimensionless parameters such as the Fourier number (Fo), the Damk€ohler number (Da), the Peclet number (Pe), and others.15,22 In calcu- lations of these parameters, the characteristic mixing time in reactors should be obtained and then compared with other characteristic times (e.g., the characteristic reaction time and the residence time). In polymerization processes, the produc- tion of polymers greatly affects the viscosity and substance diffusivity of the reaction mixture, resulting in the difficulty on accurately estimating the mixing time and characterizing the influence of the mixing performance on the polymerization performance in conventional reactors. With the aid of its fast heat transfer rate, microreactors provide an effective pathway for precise control over the reaction temperature on which the characteristic reaction time usually strongly depends accord- ing to the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the residence time (reaction time) can be easily controlled by changing the flow rate of the reaction mixture or the reactor volume.

Figure 11 shows the effect of the capillary inner diameter on the acrylamide polymerization at a constant residence time. Interestingly, it was found that the monomer conversion was improved with the increase of capil- lary diameter (Figure 11). As is well known, the free radical polymerization of acrylamide is a highly exothermic reaction. The capillary with a smaller inner diameter had a higher heat- transfer rate than the capillary with a larger inner diameter. Therefore, the heat produced in the polymerization could be removed more quickly from the capillary with a smaller inner diameter (e.g., di 5 0.508 mm). In other words, the tempera- ture gradient possibly existed in the capillary with a larger diameter (e.g., di 5 1.548 mm). The schematic diagram of a heat balance analysis for the poly- merization in capillary microreactors is shown in Figure 12.
