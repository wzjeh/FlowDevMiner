All other connections were made with standard HPLC fittings. Hydrogen and oxygen flows were separately controlled via mass flow controllers (MKS). Typical flow rates were 2 and 4 mL/min, respectively. The two gases were mixed using a T-coupling. The li- quid phase, a solution of 0.1 N HCl and 0.281 mM KBr in methanol, was then added to the gas stream through the side port of another T-coupling at a rate of 0.5 mL/h via a syringe pump (Harvard Appa- ratus). The reactor effluent was passed through a gas–liquid sepa- rator kept in an ice bath. To avoid the accumulation of dangerous concentrations of hydrogen gas, the outlet of the reactor was di- luted with nitrogen to below the explosive limit and removed through a vent line. The system was allowed to stabilize for 2 h at ambient temperature and pressure before the liquid effluent was collected. The hydrogen peroxide formed was quantitatively determined by colorimetry using the TiOSO4/H2SO4 reagent [40]. The UV-absorption of the complex was measured at 425 nm. The liquid effluent from the microreactor was collected to test for the leaching of palladium as described above. In order to determine conversion and selectivity, the total gas flow at the inlet and after the reactor was determined with a bubble flow meter. Since water is the only by-product formed, its concentration can then be calcu- lated from a mass balance. The selectivity is given as moles H2O2/ (H2O + H2O2). The samples of the gas before and after reaction were also collected with a gas tight syringe and the content of H2 and O2 was determined with a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Pack- ard 5890 Plus with thermal conductivity detector; column: molec- ular sieve 5A, 90 � 1/800; carrier gas N2).\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

(1), the mass transfer can also be improved by increasing the flow velocity u of the unit cell. Higher velocity of the unit cell is achieved by maintaining a constant gas and liquid flow rate and decreasing the inner diameter of the reactor at the same time. The results in Table 5 show that the productivity of hydrogen peroxide increased from 0.34 to 2.28 mol/h gPd when the reaction was ran in narrower capillaries. The productivity per unit palla- dium obtained with a microreactor of 0.53 mm diameter was about six times higher than in one with 2 mm inner diameter. These results clearly confirm that a smaller diameter resulted in a higher velocity of the unit cell and therefore a better liquid-gas mass transfer. However, the concentration of the hydrogen perox- ide was lower for the smaller diameter reactor. This is due to the significantly smaller amounts of catalyst-coated on the wall of the narrower capillary. The amount of catalyst deposited onto the walls of the capillary depends on the volume of the solution from which the catalyst was deposited. It will therefore scale with r2 (r is the radius of the capillary) if a constant number of impreg- nation steps is used.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Extensive studies have therefore been carried out on the direct catalytic formation of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxy- gen (Scheme 1). The reaction is triphasic, involving a gas (H2 and O2), liquid, and solid phase (catalyst). Control of the selectivity of hydrogen peroxide formation and its subsequent decomposition and hydrogenation to water remains a major challenge. In order to achieve a more favorable equilibrium and higher conversion, most reported processes involve extreme operating conditions such as high pressures of 50–96 bar [5–8]. Palladium has been identified as the best catalyst. It has been used in a variety of forms, e.g., as colloids [9–11] or is supported on supports such as silica, titania, and zirconia, or as alloys [12– 20] in aqueous or methanolic acid solutions. Using palladium sup- ported on alumina, Choudhary et al. [16] studied the effect of var- ious halide ions and established that the best promoter for hydrogen peroxide formation is the bromide ion. Furthermore, the leaching of palladium from the support was reduced in the presence of phosphoric acid. The nature of the support has a major influence on the selectivity of the catalyst.

An obvious drawback in the formation of hydrogen peroxide from H2 and O2 is the very wide explosive regime, 5–96 vol%, in the H2/O2 system. To avoid the potential hazards from direct con- tact between H2 and O2, catalytic membranes [21–23] and a fuel cell design [24,25] have been proposed. Melada et al. [22] studied the continuous formation of hydrogen peroxide over Pd/Pt on car- bon-coated membranes. A relatively low hydrogen peroxide con- centration of 400 ppm was obtained using O2-saturated acidic solutions in the presence of bromide ions and hydrogen, fed in at 3 bar. Another approach is the use of microreactors to achieve the direct formation of hydrogen peroxide. Microreactors mitigate the inherent hazards of a thermal runaway because their large surface to volume ratio allows for highly efficient heat transfer. Further- more, the free radicals that are needed to sustain the chain reaction during an explosion are efficiently quenched through wall colli- sions. The volume hold-up in microreactors is also very small. Mic- roreactors are therefore inherently safe. In many cases, higher product yield and purity have been achieved in microreactors than in conventional equipment due to a much higher gas–liquid mass transfer coefficient [26]. Another advantage of these small-scale systems is that they can be built at the point of use, and a simple numbering-out allows for rapid capacity increases. Despite these advantages, there are only a few reports on the use of microreactors for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide. Using a single chan- nel packed-bed microreactor at 20 bar and 50 �C, Voloshin et al. [27–29] obtained hydrogen peroxide as a 1.3 wt% solution. Maehara et al. [30] reduced the total system size by using water electrolysis to generate H2 and O2 instead of feeding these gases from gas cylin- ders. The gases were subsequently passed through a Pd/C-coated stacked microreactor. A relatively modest hydrogen peroxide con- centration of 8.3 � 10�3 mol/L (0.028 wt %) was obtained at 10 �C in a 0.1 mol/L solution of HCl with a residence time of 93 s. We have previously reported on the synthesis of hydrogen perox- ide over silica-supported Pd/Pt using two different packed-bed mic- roreactor designs [31]. Experiments with a multi-channel design with multiple parallel channels revealed difficulties in maintaining a constant and uniform two-phase flow through all channels. Be- cause of the high surface tension of the liquid, liquid plugs can form, leading to a much increased pressure drop over the affected channel. In turn, the gas will flow through the other channels and no catalytic reaction can take place in the plugged channel. Microreactors can be made from a wide range of materials, and a variety of fabrication techniques have been proposed such as LIGA (German: Lithographie-Galvanoplastik-Abformung, translating to lithography, electroforming, and molding), DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etching), laser ablation, photolithography, hot embossing, injec- tion moulding, powder blasting, and microlamination [32]. How- ever, all these techniques require special fabrication equipment and skills. Here, we report a simpler, easier, and cheaper design, namely a single-capillary microreactor for the direct formation of hydrogen peroxide. As our earlier investigations indicated that the pressure drop in a packed bed is a major concern, we choose an open channel wall-coated system instead, where the palladium catalyst\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

At a higher liquid feed rate, the length of the unit cell becomes\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

Initial trials with pure water gave low H2O2 yields. Methanol was therefore chosen as the solvent be- cause the solubility of H2 is three times and that of O2 eight times higher in methanol than in water [18]. Furthermore, alcoholic hydrogen peroxide would be compatible with the subsequent pro- cesses, e.g., in the production of propylene oxide [11–13,26]. Using pure methanol as the solvent, the hydrogen conversion was as high as 47%, but hydrogen peroxide was obtained only with a concen- tration of 28 mM. After the addition of potassium bromide to the methanol, the concentration increased to 47 mM. Even better re- sults were obtained when the methanol was acidified. Sulfuric acid was tested as it does not cause the specific corrosive effects of ha- lide ions such as pitting and stress corrosion. The achievable hydrogen peroxide concentration increased significantly, from 28 mM to 156 mM. When the methanol was acidified with hydro- chloric acid, the final concentration was slightly lower at 107 mM. A further increase in the hydrogen peroxide concentration was ob- tained when potassium bromide was added to the acidified meth- anol. Using MeOH/H2SO4/KBr as the solvent doubled the hydrogen peroxide concentration to 278 mM, while in the MeOH/HCl/KBr system, the hydrogen peroxide obtained had a concentration of 326 mM. With the latter liquid phase composition, the productiv- ity of the hydrogen peroxide at 0.54 mol/h gPd is about 10 times that observed in pure methanol. Both the hydrogen and halide ions (Cl� and Br�) are known to promote the hydrogen peroxide yield by inhibiting its hydrogenation and decomposition [10,14,41]. The halide ions presumably block the active sites (consisting of ensembles of metal atoms) for the dissociation of the O–O bond. This is reflected in the dramatic increase in the hydrogen peroxide selectivity from 0.65% without additives to 77% in the system with H2SO4 and Br�, which is the result of a largely decreased H2 conver- sion (from 47% to only 3.9%). The observed selectivities are compa- rable to those observed in a batch reactor under 6 bar total pressure (see data under Supplementary material, Table S-1).\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The productivity decreased over the next 3 days to stabilize at a constant value of 0.27 mol/h gPd, which is 77% of the initial activity. The productivity was maintained at this level until the experiment was terminated after another 5 days. The con- centration of hydrogen peroxide obtained during the period of highest productivity was 0.9 wt%. The observed decrease in activity between day 4 and day 6 can be attributed to a loss of palladium from the microreactor. This may be palladium particles which are not tightly incarcerated in the polymer and can be easily removed by the acidic liquid phase. Indeed, no further decrease in hydrogen peroxide productivity was observed with continued operation of the microreactor after this time. A control experiment, using an acidand halogen-free solu- tion of methanol in water as the liquid phase, showed that the amount of palladium in the reactor effluent was below detection limit. The palladium content in the film was analyzed by ICP-AES after the run and was found to be 10% lower than that in the fresh film. This loss in palladium can account for half of the observed de- cline in productivity. Another contributing factor is the formation of bigger palladium particles and agglomeration of palladium clus- ters. Transmission electron micrographs of the polymer film after the reaction (Fig. 2d) showed the presence of palladium crystallites with a diameter of up to 4.8 nm, in addition to many small parti- cles that were similar in size or even smaller than the 2.7 nm par- ticles in the as-synthesized film (Fig. 2b). The growth of bigger palladium particles at the expense of smaller ones (Ostwald ripen- ing) will result in lower catalyst dispersion which adequately ex- plains the observed reduction in activity up to day 6. The stable hydrogen peroxide productivity obtained thereafter suggests that the tightly bound PMI–Pd crystallites were stable toward leaching and particle growth.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
