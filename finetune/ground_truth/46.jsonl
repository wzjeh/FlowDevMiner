The nitration of iso-octanol with HNO3-H2SO4 mixed acid was chosen as a typical model reaction which involved fast and strong exothermic liquid-liquid heterogeneous reaction process. The influences of mixed acid composition, flow rate, organic/aqueous flow ratio and reaction temperature have been investigated. The results indicated that the reaction could be con- ducted safely and stably in the microreactor at 25�40°C, which are enhanced compared to 15°C or below for safe operating conditions in the conventional reactors. Moreover, the 98.2% conversion of iso-octanol could be obtained and no by-products were detected in all cases.

The products from the microreactor with or without cold trap section were respectively collected to compare quantitatively the conversion of the iso-octanol under same reaction conditions, as shown in Table 2. It was shown that the conversion of the iso-octanol in the microreactor without cold trap section was higher than with cold trap section due to the longer reaction time, indicating the tube connected to the output or the long channels of the microreactor were in favor of enhancing the conversion of the iso-octanol. In fact, it is observed that the reaction is still mainly accomplished in the microreactor system, ensuring the safety of reaction process and the purity of product. It can be seen that the conversion reached 98.2% in the microreactor without cold crap when the reaction temperature was 35°C, the residence time was 7.2 s, and the HNO3/C8H17OH mole ratio was 1.5. So the nitration of iso-octanol can be carried out in the microreactor efficiently and safely.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The flow rate and composition of mixed acid were regulated to optimize the operating conditions. Short Teflon tubes with an inner diameter of 3 mm were used to connect all modules. Following the reaction section, there was a cold trap in which the reacting liquid-liquid mixtures were rapidly diluted and cooled to 0°C with ice-water mixture to terminate the reaction instantaneously. Moreover, organic aqueous two phases were separated quickly. The or- ganic phase was washed by water and Na2CO3 (AR, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) solution up to neutralization. The composition of organic phase was identified and quantified by gas chromatograph (GC) with nitrogen as the carrier gas, and a flame ionization detector (FID), an OV-101 capillary column (0.25 �m film thickness, 0.25×50 m) were used. An internal standardization method was used following the procedure given by Grob [17]. Fig. 3 showed the graph of the gas chromatograph. The concentration of the unreacted iso-octanol was calculated from the concentration of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate since no other products or by-products were found to be formed in this process as shown in Fig. 3. The conversion of iso-octanol was calculated as the following equation.\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.

The nitration of iso-octanol with mixed acid exhibits the typical features of the fast highly exothermic reaction, even potentially explosion or side reactions associated. The characteristics of the nitration process were investigated by studying the effect of mixed acid composition and operating conditions on the conver- sion of iso-octanol and the average reaction rate. The results showed that the reaction could be almost com- pleted in the microreactor system under some particu- lar reaction conditions. Also, the reaction could be conducted safely and stably in the microreactor at 25�40°C, which are enhanced compared to 15°C or below for safe operating conditions in the conven- tional reactors. Moreover, no by-product was formed and 98.2% of the conversion of iso-octanol could be obtained. Microreactors with enhanced heat and mass transfer combined with small internal channel dimen- sions offer an excellent tool to reduce overall effort to commercial processes for fast exothermic liquid-liquid heterogeneous phase reaction.

Moreover, the overall nitration reaction process performed safely and stably, and no other by-products were found, whereas oxidation occurred even at lower temperature in the conventional reactor.

The interfacial area be- tween two immiscible fluids stretches, deforms, and folds with the increase of LHSV, as well as the surface renewal velocity is enhanced, making the interphase mass transfer more effective, which significantly in- tensifies mass transfer process and increases the over- all volumetric mean mass transfer coefficient. There- fore, the average reaction rate increased with the ve- locity in the mass transfer controlled systems. Obvi- ously, this effect on the mass transfer was relatively severe in the mixed acid system with higher sulfuric acid strength. Moreover, when LHSV was high enough, the reaction would be controlled by kinetics rather than mass transfer, so average reaction rate achieved limit value as shown in Fig. 6.

Zaldivar et al. [18, 19] has indicated that the nitra- tion of aromatics falls into the fast reaction regime at H2SO4 strengths of 70%�80% (by mass) in mixed acid. However, the H2SO4 strengths of mixed acid are larger than 80% (by mass) in our experiments. In addition, alcohols are more easily nitrated by mixed acid under the same conditions compared to the aromatics. Thus, in the iso-octanol nitration liquid-liquid heterogeneous process with HNO3-H2SO4 mixed acid, the reaction rate can be calculated by an interfacial nitration model aimed at fast reaction regimes, and the average reac- tion rate is adopted in this paper. This model assumes that organic nitration occurs in the aqueous phase close to the interface and is controlled by mass trans- fer of organic phase across the interface of liquid-liquid two phases, and the reaction occurs within the mixed acid phase.

Their mass compo- sition was 58% H2SO4 and 26% HNO3, and 74% H2SO4 and 24% HNO3, respectively. The average re- action rate is plotted against LHSV in Figs. 6 and 7. It could be seen that the average reaction rate was di- rectly proportional to LHSV for both reaction systems, implicating these nitration processes were still limited by mass transfer in the microreactor. In fact, the effect of LHSV was more remarkable in the mixed acid with higher sulfuric acid strength because the reaction rate was faster and the nitration process was more greatly limited by mass transfer performance of liquid-liquid immiscible two phases. According to our previous research [24], the flow regimes selected for the present investigation are mainly the parallel flow with smooth interface, the parallel flow with wavy interface, and even the chaotic thin striations flow in this microreac- tor. The hydrodynamic characteristics of mass transfer in these flow regimes have been systematically inves- tigated. The overall volumetric mass transfer coeffi- cients obtained are more than two or three orders of\n\nTask\nOnly use the provided paragraph; do not infer across other paragraphs.\nSTRICT EXTRACTION POLICY:\n- Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly and unambiguously named in THIS paragraph.\n- DO NOT GUESS or INVENT any chemical, role, condition, reactor, product or metrics.\n- If role for a chemical is not explicitly stated near its name, OMIT that chemical entirely (prefer an empty list over guessing).\n- SKIP generic placeholders (e.g., monomer(s), reactant(s), feedstock(s), mixture, solution, linear chains, arm precursor, star core, reaction mixture).\n- Deduplicate case-insensitively; prefer singular names; keep explicit abbreviations as shown in text (e.g., BA, ACMO, DMF, ABVN, DoPAT, HDDA).\n- If conflicting info exists, choose null and DO NOT resolve by speculation.\nIf a field is not explicitly stated, use null.
