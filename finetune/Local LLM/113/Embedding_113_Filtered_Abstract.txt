Since the flow state of the reaction in the microchannel is laminar, a laminar flow model was used. And the species transport model without response was set during mixing. The mass fraction was placed at one order upwind, and the velocity convergence was set to 10−6. 3.7.3. Validation of Mixed Eﬃciency.

divergent sections to increase the mass transfer rate. The internal volume of the microchannel is 30 mL with 10 channel units. The residence time was changed by varying the number of plates. The flow rate of the target reaction layer is 0−100 mL/min, and the operating temperature and pressure are −30 to 200 °C and 0−20 bar, respectively. The model with a precise high-pressure pump is Sanotac-MPF05

where r is the diameter of the inlet, 1.4 mm. We get the Reynolds numbers at the channel of the heart cells in the microreactor range from 20 to 160; therefore the behavior of the laminar flow is studied. The nonlinear relationship between the pressure drop and Reynolds number is depicted in Figure 10. The power-law ΔP = 0.0245Re1.4739 suggests that the significant friction on small scales is rela

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for the synthesis of organic compounds using microreactors. The reaction involves the conversion of alkynes and amines under ambient pressure and temperature conditions. A continuous ﬂow reactor with a high interfacial area is used, allowing for better heat transfer and mass transport. The key reactants are alkynes and amines, while the solvent is toluene. A heterogeneous catalyst is employed to facilitate the reaction. The products of the synthesis include various organic compounds with improved selectivity. The critical conditions for this process include a flow rate of 10 mL/min, residence time of 6 hours, and temperature of 25°C. Overall, the use of microreactors in this flow-chemistry process leads to enhanced conversion and yield while maintaining high selectivity.

Recirculation zones are formed between these two obstacles, increasing the amplitude with rising flow rates, especially obvious under a flow rate reaching 30 mL/min.
