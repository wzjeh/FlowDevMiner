the most widely marketed drugs in the world due to their outstanding eﬃcacy and safety.19 As shown in Figure 1, lansoprazole 1a, pantaprazole 1b and rabeprazole 1c are members of benzimidazole drugs that act as proton pump inhibitor (PPIs) and therefore used to prevent ulcers.20

ABSTRACT: Synthesis of pharmaceutically active com- pounds by employing continuous flow micromixing reactor technology is an interesting research area. In this article we describe the synthesis of benzimidazole core drugs, such as lansoprazole (1a), pantaprazole (1b), and rabeprazole (1c) by using a continuous flow micromixing reactor technology. A key feature of the sulfoxidation includes the decreasing the reaction time from 3 h to ∼1 s to minimize the formation of sulfone impurities and improve the yields. ■INTRODUCTION Development of eﬃcient and cost-eﬀective synthetic processes for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is a challenging task for the pharmaceutical industry. The technologies employed in the development of APIs are primarily long- established batch processes.1−5 Even though the traditional technologies have achieved an impressive progress in the synthesis of various APIs, there is scope to further integrate with the emerging continuous technologies,6−8 such as micromixing reactor, microreactor, plug flow reactor, spinning disk reactor and loop reactor, static mixers, etc. These technologies, compared to those commonly used today, are expected to bring dramatic improvements in manufacturing and processing, substantially decreasing the equipment size, production capacity ratio, energy consumption, and ultimately resulting in less expensive, sustainable technologies.9−11 One of the advantages obtainable through the application of emerging engineering technologies is cost-eﬀective process intensification in terms of heat and mass transfer.12 Moreover, over the past few years the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries have shown an increasing interest in considering process intensified technology as a viable alternative to the traditional stirred tank reactors.13−15 Drivers for this are considerably reduced capital investment cost, reliable scale-up, and increased inherent safety due to a relatively small reacting inventory.16,17 Although continuous processing technologies such as static mixers have been successfully used in the oil industry for a significant length of time, literature about their application to the manufacture of APIs, drug intermediates, or fine chemicals is limited.18

Recently we reported an eﬃcient, scalable synthesis of antiulcer drugs (1a−1c), by employing aqueous sodium hypochlorite (cost: ∼$0.1/kg) in place of expensive m-CPBA (cost: ∼$44/kg) for oxidation of thioether 6a−6c (Scheme 1).21 The NaOCl oxidation significantly improved the yield and quality of the sulfoxides, generating only NaCl and H2O as by products. The first step of our synthesis commences with

To evaluate the performance of continuous processing technologies we investigated the application of continuous flow micromixing reactor technology for synthesis of benzimidazole drugs, which are a group of drugs that elicit pronounced and long-lasting pharmacological eﬀect by reducing the gastric acid production.

condensation of pyridine compounds 4a, 4b, and 4c and thio compounds 5a, 5b, and 5c in the presence of sodium hydroxide using water as a solvent to aﬀord thioether compounds 6a−6c, respectively. Subsequently the 6a−6c compounds were oxidized with sodium hypochlorite in a mixture of water and acetonitrile solvent system to yield 1a, 1b, and 1c compounds (Scheme 1). Although our earlier approach21 eﬃciently provided the desired sulfoxides 1a−1c, controlling the formation of sulfone byproducts 7a−7c (Figure 2) required strict process controls such as mole equivalence of oxidant and reaction stirring time and temperature.

micromixing reactor made up of SS-316 consists of two inlets and one outlet. This type of micromixer reactor is based on the principle of high-shear axial collision. For that purpose each micromixing reactor contains two slit angles at 180° with diameters varying from 0.35−1.5 mm and an aperture at 90° above both slits with diameter varying from 0.35−1.5 mm and having a mixing volume of 0.2−1 mL. The micromixer reactors were connected with stainless-steel tube tubing through pumps P1and P2 for feeding the reagents, and the product was collected from the outlet of reactor. To vary the residence time, flow rates were changed. The micromixer reactors were placed in a locally fabricated double jacketed stainless-steel water bath equipped with Julaboo heating and cooling circulator with external temperature sensor. To increase the residence time or oﬀer multiple collisions, a series of micromixers was connected for maximum conversion. For reactions with one step, quenching can be done by using another micromixing reactor with inlet 1 from M1 and inlet 2 connected through pump P3 with a quenching agent. An external coil can also be connected to the outlet of a micromixer for the reactions which are moderately slow. P1, P2, and P3 are pumps from Knauer with 0−1000 L/min. Diﬀerent pump heads for regulating the flow rates of the M1 and M2 micromixer reactors were fabricated from local vendors (SS-316 and Hastelloy 22). Investigation of Alkylation of Sulfides. Our inves- tigation started with condensation of pyridine compound 4a and thio compound 5a in the presence of sodium hydroxide and water. In this study the 4a solution was first injected into a T-shaped micromixer by using a Knauer preparative pump (P1). At the same time, a mixture of 5a (1 equiv of 5a, 2.1 equiv of NaOH solution) was also injected into the micromixture by using another pump (P2). At this point, identical flow rates were maintained for pumps P1 and P2. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was admitted through a stainless steel tube, and conversion of 6a was observed within ∼1 s. Afterwards, the product stream was diluted with water and 6a was isolated by filtration in 97.1% yield with 99.6% HPLC purity. Thereafter the same protocol was performed for condensation of 4b and 4c and 5b and 5c and corresponding intermediates, 6b and 6c, with 97.2% and 96.9% yields and 99.3% and 99.5% HPLC purity, respectively. With this investigation the alkylated sulfides (6a−6c) were prepared with comparable yields of the batch processes and also the reaction times decreased from 5 h to ∼1 s (Table 1). Investigation of Sulfoxidation Step. Sulfoxidation is the crucial step in the synthesis of prazole drugs because the formation of overoxidation sulfone impurity is the common problem for all benzimidazole drugs (Figure 2). In this sulfoxidation, first a solution of 6a in acetonitrile (200 mL/ min) was injected into a T-shaped micromixer by using a

In order to intensify the above process, we investigated the alkylation of sulfides and subsequent sulfoxidation in micro- mixing reactor technology, and the same has been described in this article. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In our investigation the above optimized protocol21 of 1a−1c was directly taken (with minor process modification) and tested in the continuous flow micromixing reactor (see Experimental Section).

Knauer preparative pump (P1). At the same time, a solution of aq NaOCl with aq NaOH was also injected into a micromixter by another Knauer preparative pump (P2). The flow rates of pumps P1 and P2 were adjusted to maintain the mole ratio of reagents. In this high-shear axial collision, the sulfoxidation reaction was completed within ∼1 s. The selectivity of 1a was observed at 97.94%, and sulfone 7a was 0.02% in the reaction mass HPLC analysis. Afterwards, the product 1a stream was diluted with water (P3 pump) and the pH adjusted to 9.0−9.5; 1a was isolated as a solid with 90% yield and 98.5% purity and sulfone 7a at 0.02%. Here, the flow rate of reagents appears to be crucial in achieving the best selectivity of sulfoxide 1a. By decreasing the flow rate of reagents to 100 mL/min, the selectivity of 1a was decreased to 95.72% with 0.30% of 7a. When the flow rate was increased to 250 mL/min, the selectivity of 1a achieved 97.94%, and that of 7a was 0.08% (Table 2 and Figure 4). The reason for this may be a short

Hence, the number of micromixers was further increased from three to five (M4, M5), and the conversion was improved to 95.2%. Certainly, the extended micromixing collisions allowed the substrate 6c and oxidant NaOCl to react eﬃciently and aﬀord the maximum conversion of 1c. Hence, the five micromixers were employed in further flow rate optimization studies (Table 4 and Figure 5).

Afterward the flow rate of 6c was examined; in this experiment, incomplete conversions and formation of higher levels of sulfone 7c impurity were observed when the flow rates were increased to 200 and 250 mL/min. On other hand, maximum conversion was achieved with the flow rate of 150 mL/min (Table 5).

residence time (200 mL/min) so that the formed 1a product may not be available for the oxidant, thus minimizing the formation of the 7a impurity, whereas in delayed residence time (100 mL/min) the formed product 1a may be contacting the oxidant and thus lead to the formation of 7a (Table 2). Hence, the shorter residence time (flow rate 200 mL/min) was chosen as an optimal condition for further examination of process parameters. We then examined the sulfoxidation of 6b and 6c with diﬀerent flow rates of reagents by increasing the flow rate to 300 mL/min. The obtained selectivity of 1b was only 95% purity, with 1.36% of 6b and 0.40% of 7b observed, whereas decreasing the flow rate to 100 mL/min provided 1b with 95.56% purity and 0.76% of 6b. Hence, the optimal 200 mL/ min flow rate was chosen for further examination of process parameters (Table 3). In the case of 1c synthesis, first the 6c solution and aq NaOCl solution was injected into T-shaped micromixture with a flow rate 150 mL/min. In this condition only 33.3% of conversion (1c) was seen (Table 4). In order to improve the conversion, the micromixture (M1) outlet was connected to another two micromixers (M2 and M3) to perform multiple collisions, but the conversion was increased to only 52.8%.

Next, we investigated the sulfoxidation of 6a, 6b, and 6c with diﬀerent mole ratios of aq NaOCl. As shown in Figure 6, the oxidation of 6a with 1.05 equiv of sodium hypochlorite gave the best results, and the desired sulfoxide 1a was obtained in 98.9%, 7a in 0.03%, and a little higher level of 7a was observed for 1.1 and 1.2 equiv of NaOCl. In the case of 6b and 6c the maximum oxidation was achieved with a stoichiometric amount of sodium

collected from the outlet, and the compound 6a was isolated from water with yield of 97.1% and HPLC purity of 99.6%. 6b: yield 97.2%, HPLC purity 99.3%. 6c: yield 96.9%, HPLC purity 99.5%. Synthesis of Lansoprazole 1a. 2-[3-Methyl-4-(2,2,2- trifluoroethoxy)-2-pyridinyl] methylthio-1H-benzimidazole 6a (20 kg, 56.29 mmol) solution was prepared by dissolving the 6a into a solution of acetonitrile (60 L) and NaOH (2.72 kg, 68 mmol in 8 L of water). This 6a solution along with a mixture of aq NaOCl (46 kg, 67.91 mmol) and NaOH solution (1.36 kg, 34 mmol in 4 L water) was fed into a T-shaped micromixer M1 by using pump P1 (volume/flow rate: 80.0 L mL/553.85 L/ min) and P2 (volume/flow rate: 50 L/346.15 L/min) at a total flow rate of 900 mL/min, respectively. The outlet was connected to another micromixer, M2, which was fed with water (60 L) by using pump P3 (flow rate: 415.38 L/min) to quench the reaction mass. After that the reaction mixture from M3 was collected into the reactor, and pH was adjusted to 9.0− 9.5 by using 10% acetic acid at 0−10 °C. To this suspension was added the water (140 L), and the mixture was stirred for 4 h. The isolated solid was filtered and dried to give the crude 1a in 89% yield (18.5 kg) with 94.5% HPLC purity. After that the crude 1a was recrystallized from the THF and water (1:2, 16 vol) and 1a was obtained as a slurry from ethyl acetate (3 vol), and 1a was obtained pure in 79.4% yield with 99.9% HPLC purity. Synthesis of Pantaprazole 1b. A solution of 5- (difluoromethoxy)-2-[[3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl)methyl]- thio]-1H-benzimidazole 6b (100 g, 0.272 mol) in acetonitrile (500 mL) and a mixture of aq NaOCl solution (156 g, 0.272 mol, 13% w/w) and NaOH (10.9 g, 0.272 mol in 44 mL of water) was fed into a T-shaped micromixer, M1, at a total flow rate of 202 mL/min using P1 (volume/flow rate: 580 mL/150 mL/min) and P2 (volume/flow rate: 200 mL/52 mL/min) pumps. The outlet from the micromixer is connected to another micromixer, M2, and the reaction mass was quenched using water (2000 mL) fed by the P3 pump (flow rate: 518 mL/min). Then the mixture was filtered and cooled to 0−5 °C; the pH of the reaction mass was adjusted to 6.0−6.5 by using 1 N HCl solution. Thereafter, the isolated solid was filtered and dried to obtain crude 1b in 94.8% yield (98.9 g) with 97.9% HPLC purity. After that, the dried product 1b was slurried in ethyl acetate solvent (380 mL), and 89.8% yield (88.8 g) with 99.5% HPLC purity of 1b was achieved. Synthesis of Rabeprazole 1c. 2-[[[4-(3-Methoxypro- poxy)-3-methyl-2-pyridinyl]methyl]thio]-1H-benzimidazole solution was prepared by dissolving 6c (100 g, 0.292 mol) in acetonitrile (300 mL) and NaOH solution (NaOH 30 g in 120 mL of water) in a container; aq NaOCl solution (156 g, 0.272

hypochlorite, and with increasing the oxidant to 1.1 or 1.2 equiv, the formation of relatively higher levels of 7b and 7c were observed (Figure 6). Rapid mixing using the micromixer enabled us to oxidize sulfides (6a−6c) in a shorter reaction time, and regulation of the relative amount of sodium hypochlorite to that of the sulfides by using pumps prevented formation of the over- oxidation impurity (7a).24

We compared the results obtained from continuous flow micromixing reactor synthesis with the batch process synthesis (Table 6). The results clearly reveal that the application of platform micromixing reactor technology not only reduced reaction time from hours to seconds but also improved the overall yield and throughput of benzimidazole drugs. ■CONCLUSION In conclusion, we successfully investigated and established platform micromixing reactor technology for the synthesis of benzimidazole core drugs such as lansoprazole 1a, pantaprazole 1b, and rabeprazole 1c. A key feature of the sulfoxidation includes decreasing the reaction time from 3 h to ∼1 s to minimize the formation of sulfone impurities and improve the yields.■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Both solutions were fed into a T-shaped micromixer M1 at a total flow rate of 150 mL/min by using P1 (volume/flow rate: 480 mL/109 mL/ min) and P2 (volume/flow rate: 180 mL/41 mL/min) pumps, and the outlet M1 was connected to another micromixer M2 which was connected with quenching agent hypochlorite solution (40 g in 200 mL of water) and was fed by using another pump P3 (flow rate: 50 mL/min). After that the outcome product 1c was collected and treated with charcoal (20 g). Subsequently, the charcoal was removed by filtration, and the filtrate solution was washed with toluene (100 mL). Afterward the filtrate solution was cooled to 0−5 °C, and the pH was adjusted to 8.0−8.5 by using acetic acid (∼30 mL). Then the isolated solid was filtered and dried to obtain the crude 1c in 88.2% yield (108.6 g) with 98.7% HPLC purity. After that, crude 1c was recrystallized from acetone (350 mL) to obtain the pure 1c in 85.1% yield (92.4 g) with 99.5% HPLC purity. ■AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Author *Tel.: + 91 40 4434 6117.
