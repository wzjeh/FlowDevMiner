nitroaromatic compound in toluene) seems to be the rate-de- termining step of the process. At higher flow rates of H2 (30 mLmin¢1), the conversion of nitroaromatic compound and selectivity for hydrogenation of a nitro group are inde- pendent of the gas velocity, which indicates that, under these conditions, external mass-transfer limitations are absent. Sub- sequently, all catalytic tests were pe

The time-on stream performance of the Au/Al2O3 catalyst under the conditions of liquid-phase hydrogenation of substi- tuted nitrobenzenes in a packed-bed flow reactor was studied at 808C and the hydrogen pressure of 10 bar for up to 2 h of continuous operation. During this period, liquid samples of the reaction flow were taken every 20 min at the reactor outlet and analyzed by GC. As a result, smo

To date, hydrogenation of aromatic nitro compounds was performed in either liquid-phase batch reactors[5–8] or gas- phase flow reactors[4,9,10] and, to the best of our knowledge, has never been examined under continuous liquid-phase flow conditions. Meanwhile, the last decade has witnessed rapid

Summary: The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process development for the conversion of 3-vinylbenzene (3-VNB) over an Au/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor under varying reaction temperatures and constant H2 flow rate. The key reactants are 3-VNB, solvent is not mentioned, and the catalyst is Au/Al2O3. The products are not specified. The reactor type is a fixed-bed reactor with an inlet H2/3-VNB molar ratio>35 to avoid external mass-transfer limitations. Critical conditions include varying reaction temperatures (not mentioned), constant H2 flow rate of 60 mLmin¢1, and residence time t (fixed at different values for each temperature). The outcomes are displayed in Figure 3a as the conversion of 3-VNB measured 30–38 min after the start of the experiment.
