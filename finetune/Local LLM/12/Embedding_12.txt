nitroaromatic compound in toluene) seems to be the rate-de- termining step of the process. At higher flow rates of H2 (30 mLmin¢1), the conversion of nitroaromatic compound and selectivity for hydrogenation of a nitro group are inde- pendent of the gas velocity, which indicates that, under these conditions, external mass-transfer limitations are absent. Sub- sequently, all catalytic tests were performed at a high hydro- gen flow rate of 60 mLmin¢1. As a result of special tests, we found that an enlargement of the catalyst grain sizes from 125–250 to 350–500 mm had no considerable effect on the conversion measured at a hydrogen flow rate of 60 mLmin¢1, which implied negligible influence of internal mass transfer under the conditions used.

Reaction conditions: a packed-bed flow reactor; [3-VNB]inlet=0.05m; solvent: toluene; p(H2)=10 bar; mass of the catalyst: 0.185 g; flow rates of the liquid phase and H2: 0.5–1.5 and 60 mLmin¢1, respectively; reaction time=30–38 min.

The time-on stream performance of the Au/Al2O3 catalyst under the conditions of liquid-phase hydrogenation of substi- tuted nitrobenzenes in a packed-bed flow reactor was studied at 808C and the hydrogen pressure of 10 bar for up to 2 h of continuous operation. During this period, liquid samples of the reaction flow were taken every 20 min at the reactor outlet and analyzed by GC. As a result, smooth deactivation of the catalyst with time on-stream was observed, regardless of the substrate used for hydrogenation. As an example, Figure 4a

To date, hydrogenation of aromatic nitro compounds was performed in either liquid-phase batch reactors[5–8] or gas- phase flow reactors[4,9,10] and, to the best of our knowledge, has never been examined under continuous liquid-phase flow conditions. Meanwhile, the last decade has witnessed rapid

During all tests, the carbon balance between the inlet and outlet streams was within (952)%.

The effect of residence time in the reactor on the 3-VNB conversion over the Au/Al2O3 catalyst was further studied at different reaction temperatures. The residence time (t) was fixed at a constant H2 flow rate of 60 mLmin¢1. Thus, during all experiments, a large excess of H2 was maintained in the reac- tion media (inlet H2/3-VNB molar ratio>35) to avoid external mass-transfer limitations. Figure 3a displays the 3-VNB conver- sion measured 30–38 min after the start of the experiment versus t for three different reaction temperatures. The experi- mental data are described by Equation (1):
