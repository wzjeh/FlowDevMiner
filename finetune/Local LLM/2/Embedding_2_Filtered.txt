Currently, the application of microreactor technology on chemistry

Reynolds number (Re) is an important dimensionless parameter for predicting flow mechanics/patterns under diﬀerent conditions [28,32]. To evaluate variations of the mass transfer and the polymerization process with diﬀerent Reynolds numbers, the total volumetric flow rate was changed while maintaining the volumetric flow rate ratio of the aqueous phase to the organic phase and the residence time constant (q = Qaq: Qorg = 2, and t = 95 s) under 35 °C. This was realized by ap- plying capillary microreactors with various lengths. The mean Reynolds number of the organic and aqueous phases (ReM) was calculated based on the pseudo-homogeneous model: [28]

and chemical industry has gained increasing attention [1–7]. Micro- reactors have numerous advantages, such as larger specific surface area, higher mixing eﬃciency, faster heat and mass transfer rates, enhanced

For the polymerization process, the transport of aniline from the organic phase to the aqueous phase needed to approach and then cross the organic-aqueous interface, which was strongly dependent on the volumetric flow rate ratio of the aqueous phase to the organic phase (q). To investigate the eﬀect of the volumetric flow rate ratio on the mass transfer and the polymerization process, the total volumetric flow rate (Qtotal) was fixed at 0.5 ml/min in the capillary microreactor with the residence time of 95 s at 35 °C. Fig. 11 exhibits the photos of slug flow captured at the front part of the capillary microreactor with the var- iation of q. The dispersed phase slug length (Ls) increased with the in- crease of q. Typically, the length of the dispersed phase slug in a mi- crochannel is dependent on the volumetric flow rate ratio and physical properties of the two immiscible liquid phases. A modified capillary number (Ca*) can be introduced to reflect the eﬀects of the viscosity and the interfacial tension between the two immiscible liquid phases in the generation of the dispersed phase slug: [71]

where (Ka)phy and (Ka)phy are the overall physical volumetric mass transfer coeﬃcient and the overall chemical volumetric mass transfer coeﬃcient, respectively. Assuming that the flow pattern in the capillary microreactor with the polymerization was the same as that without the polymerization, Eq. (20) can be transformed as follows:
