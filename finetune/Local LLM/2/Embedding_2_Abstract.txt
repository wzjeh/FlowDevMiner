Summary: The paragraph discusses the polymerization process in a capillary microreactor using aniline as the reactant. The transport of aniline from the organic phase to the aqueous phase is crucial for the reaction. To investigate the effect of volumetric flow rate ratio on mass transfer and polymerization, total volumetric flow rate (Qtotal) was fixed at 0.5 ml/min with residence time of 95 s at 35 °C. The photos in Fig. 11 show slug flow variations due to changes in q. The dispersed phase slug length (Ls) increased with increasing q, and a modified capillary number (Ca*) was introduced to account for viscosity and interfacial tension effects on slug generation.

Flow-chemistry process development: Organic phase polymerization of methyl acrylate with aqueous phase initiator; Capillary microreactors used as reactors; Residence time constant (95 s); Temperature (35 °C); Flow rates maintained for volumetric flow rate ratio (Qaq: Qorg = 2); Reynolds number varied by adjusting reactor length.

The reaction rate is usually strongly dependent on the temperature that should be well controlled for highly exothermic polymerization processes. The eﬀect of the temperature on the PANI synthesis in mi- croreactors was investigated with the residence time of 95 s at constant volumetric flow rates of the aqueous phase and the organic phase.

The continuous synthesis of polyaniline was realized in capillary microreactors within liquid-liquid slug flow through the chemical oxi- dative polymerization method.

The hydrodynamics and mass transfer performance in the chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline in ca- pillary microreactors within the liquid-liquid slug flow regime were investigated. Higher reaction temperature, higher HCl concentration and larger volumetric flow rate ratio of the aqueous phase to the organic phase im- proved the mass transfer performance and thus led to higher yield of pol
