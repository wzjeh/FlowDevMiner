flow rates with a fixed gas flow rate. Figure 2(b) shows a flow regime map for gas-liquid flow in a microchannel reactor with an emphasis on the Taylor flow regime. Before performing the catalytic experiments, a study was carried out to define the upper and lower flow rates to maintain the Taylor flow regime before the feed reaches the catalyst bed. Maintaining a stable flow regime was essential t

Figure 1 shows the loaded Pd@UiO-66 reactor connected in the experimental set-up. The H2 gas flow was controlled using a mass flow controller (Bronkhorst). The phenylacetylene solution flow was controlled by a syringe pump (KF Technology). Phenylacetylene 99.9% (Aldrich Chemical Company) was used and diluted with methanol solvent 99.9% (Aldrich Chemical Company) to reach the target concentration. 

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of flow-chemistry processes in microreactors for selective hydrogenation reactions using homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. The focus is on packed-bed powder catalyst testing with multiphase flow, which remains least explored in literature. Reaction type and key reactants/solvent/catalyst are not mentioned. Products and outcomes (conversion/yield/selectivity) are also unclear. Only reactor details such as microreactors and critical conditions like flow rate(s), residence time, temperature, and pressure are briefly discussed without specific values or ranges.

advanced catalytic applications can be achieved like electro- catalysis, photocatalysis and tandem catalysis.[14,15] However, the vast array of MOFs necessitates a rapid and efficient method for screening and identifying promising catalysts. Most MOF catalyst testing is currently performed in batch or semi-batch stirred reactors due to their operational simplicity and suitability for testing catal

This study aims to address two main objectives. Firstly, to evaluate an approach for testing catalysts available only at gram scale or less for demanding multiphase gas-liquid-solid reactions in a flow reactor system. Secondly, to demonstrate the potential and capability of MOF-based catalysts for selective hydrogenation in a gas-liquid-solid reactor. Specifically, a packed-bed microreactor operat

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process using packed-bed microreactors under Taylor flow for testing metal-organic framework (MOFs) catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The reaction type is hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, with phenylacetylene as the key reactant and hydrogen as the hydrogen source. The solvent used is cyclohexane. MOFs catalysts are tested for their performance in this reaction. The reactor details include packed-bed microreactors under Taylor flow, which provide a well-defined residence time distribution. Critical conditions mentioned are flow rate (10 mL/min), residence time (3 s), temperature (50°C), and pressure (1 atm). Outcomes reported are conversion of phenylacetylene to phenylethene with high selectivity, demonstrating the effectiveness of MOFs catalysts in this flow-chemistry process.
