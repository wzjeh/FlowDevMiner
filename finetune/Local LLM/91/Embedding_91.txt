Furthermore, this process generates substantial amounts of waste acid, which, if not properly treated, can lead to severe environmental contamination, such as acidication of water bodies and soil degradation. Lastly, traditional nitration methods suﬀer from limitations in reaction selectivity and yield. The inability to precisely control reaction parameters oen results in inconsistent selectivity and yield, posing signicant challenges for achieving reliable and eﬃcient production. In recent years, continuous-ow microreaction technology has demonstrated remarkable advantages in nitration

mononitration selectivity. By optimizing the molar ratio of acid to substrate, the number of microreactor modules was reduced to ve, shortening the reaction time from 90 seconds to 29 seconds. This adjustment signicantly lowered xed costs associated with industrial implementation while enhancing process feasibility. Furthermore, integrating a waste acid recy- cling strategy eﬀectively mitigated the issue of acid disposal. Compared to our previous methodology, this new process ach- ieved notable improvements in product yield and mononitro compound selectivity.

p-Xylene, an important chemical feedstock,8,38 is widely utilized in the synthesis of dyes, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and pesti- cides. In this study, p-xylene was chosen as a model substrate for optimizing reaction conditions. First, 98% concentrated H2SO4 was diluted with water to the desired concentration and mixed with 97% concentrated HNO3 at a specic molar ratio to prepare the mixed acid. The mixed acid and p-xylene were then fed into a continuous-ow microreactor (Corning AFR Lab reactor equipped with a 2.7 mL microreactor module) through separate inlet streams (Fig. 2). Aer separating the organic phase from the reaction mixture, the products were analyzed via gas chromatography. The eﬀect of temperature on the reaction was rst investi- gated under initial conditions: p-xylene ow rate at 2 g min−1, H2SO4 concentration at 70%, H2SO4/HNO3 molar ratio at 1.2, and HNO3/p-xylene molar ratio at 1.1. Within the temperature range of 30 °C to 100 °C, substrate conversion increased with rising temperature, while mononitration selectivity initially increased and then declined. The highest selectivity was

processes, such as excellent mixing eﬃciency, high heat and mass transfer eﬃciency, minimal reactant volume, short resi- dence times, and rapid responsiveness.24,26 Building on these benets, numerous successful applications of microreactor technology in nitration have emerged, oﬀering an eﬃcient, safe, and sustainable direction for the development of industrial nitration processes.27–34 In 2015, Kulkarni and his team inves- tigated a continuous nitration process for o-xylene using a tubular reactor.35 The process employed fuming HNO3 (FNA) as the nitrating agent, achieving a 99% conversion rate of o- xylene with 7.2% dinitro impurity content. However, the required FNA amount was six times the molar quantity of o- xylene, leading to substantial reagent waste, while the maximum yield of nitro-o-xylene reached only 91.8%, leaving room for optimization. In 2023, Sh¯u Kobayashi and colleagues introduced a contin- uous-ow nitration approach using solid acid catalysts in the presence of HNO3.36 While this method demonstrated eﬀec- tiveness, its industrial scalability was hindered by the high cost of solid acid catalysts and the use of organic solvents. In 2022, our team developed an eﬃcient continuous-ow nitration process for o-xylene and its analogues (Fig. 1). This approach utilized 10 microreaction modules arranged in series, where the double-stage nitration reaction overcame the reaction equilib- rium, resulting in a mononitro-o-xylene yield of 94.1%. Despite improving substrate selectivity and yield, implementing multiple microreactor modules prolonged reaction times, reduced production eﬃciency, and increased xed capital costs. Additionally, the double-stage nitration step introduced proce- dural complexity and elevated waste acid generation, which together limited its industrial scalability.37

overabundance of nitronium ions (NO2 +), promoting the formation of unwanted polynitro by-products. Optimization experiments showed that a H2SO4 concentration of 70% provided the best selectivity (Fig. 3c). Despite these optimizations, substrate conversion remained suboptimal, primarily due to the short residence time in the continuous-ow reactor, which limited reaction completion. Increasing the number of microreactor modules to extend the residence time could enhance conversion but would signi- cantly raise the xed investment costs for industrial-scale equipment. To maintain a short reaction time, the reaction was intensied by increasing the molar ratio of HNO3 to
