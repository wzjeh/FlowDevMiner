Nitroaromatic compounds are extensively used in industries such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and dyes.

However, traditional synthesis methods often face challenges, including high safety risks, significant

environmental pollution, and poor selectivity in mononitration reactions. In this study, we developed an

eﬃcient and safe continuous-flow microreaction process for mononitration, which achieves high yield

and excellent selectivity. This process is applicable for the continuous synthesis of various mononitro compounds, including nitro-p-xylene, nitro-o-xylene, nitro-chlorobenzene, and nitro-toluene.

Furthermore, the process was successfully applied to the synthesis of a key intermediate in the

anticancer drug erlotinib, achieving a yield of 99.3%. The process has also been scaled up for the

continuous production of nitro-p-xylene and nitro-o-xylene, with a product output of 800 g h−1. Under

the same reaction conditions, the yield and selectivity were consistent with, or even improved over,

those obtained in small-scale experiments, demonstrating the scalability and industrial potential of the

process. Additionally, the process incorporates a waste acid recycling strategy, which has no significant

impact on product yield, thus enhancing economic benefits and reducing environmental pollution. This continuous nitration process not only shows broad application potential but also oﬀers a safe and

are considered more environmentally sustainable, their adop- tion in industrial production is oen constrained by high costs or diﬃculties in achieving large-scale implementation. The nitration process using a mixed acid of HNO3 and H2SO4 remains the dominant method for synthesizing nitroaromatic compounds, but it is fraught with signicant challenges. Among these, safety concerns are particularly critical.24 Nitro compounds are highly explosive, and their production involves ammable raw materials. Additionally, the highly exothermic nature of the electrophilic nitration reaction exacerbates the diﬃculty of maintaining stable reaction conditions in tradi- tional batch reactors, thereby heightening safety risks.25

Introduction

Nitroaromatic compounds represent a vital class of chemicals that serve as key precursors for aromatic amines, azo compounds, and nitrosoarenes.1,2 Their derivatives are exten- sively utilized in industries such as explosives,3 dyes,4 pesti- cides,5,6 and pharmaceuticals,7–9 highlighting their signicant role in the chemical industry and related sectors. The nitration of aromatic compounds, one of the most fundamental aromatic substitution reactions, has seen notable advancements in synthesis methods in recent years.10 Common nitrating agents include mixed acid of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4),11 HNO3,12,13 solid acid,14 nitrogen oxides,15–17 N-nitro reagents,18,19 and nitrates.20–23 Although some of these methods

Furthermore, this process generates substantial amounts of waste acid, which, if not properly treated, can lead to severe environmental contamination, such as acidication of water bodies and soil degradation. Lastly, traditional nitration methods suﬀer from limitations in reaction selectivity and yield. The inability to precisely control reaction parameters oen results in inconsistent selectivity and yield, posing signicant challenges for achieving reliable and eﬃcient production. In recent years, continuous-ow microreaction technology has demonstrated remarkable advantages in nitration

processes, such as excellent mixing eﬃciency, high heat and mass transfer eﬃciency, minimal reactant volume, short resi- dence times, and rapid responsiveness.24,26 Building on these benets, numerous successful applications of microreactor technology in nitration have emerged, oﬀering an eﬃcient, safe, and sustainable direction for the development of industrial nitration processes.27–34 In 2015, Kulkarni and his team inves- tigated a continuous nitration process for o-xylene using a tubular reactor.35 The process employed fuming HNO3 (FNA) as the nitrating agent, achieving a 99% conversion rate of o- xylene with 7.2% dinitro impurity content. However, the required FNA amount was six times the molar quantity of o- xylene, leading to substantial reagent waste, while the maximum yield of nitro-o-xylene reached only 91.8%, leaving room for optimization. In 2023, Sh¯u Kobayashi and colleagues introduced a contin- uous-ow nitration approach using solid acid catalysts in the presence of HNO3.36 While this method demonstrated eﬀec- tiveness, its industrial scalability was hindered by the high cost of solid acid catalysts and the use of organic solvents. In 2022, our team developed an eﬃcient continuous-ow nitration process for o-xylene and its analogues (Fig. 1). This approach utilized 10 microreaction modules arranged in series, where the double-stage nitration reaction overcame the reaction equilib- rium, resulting in a mononitro-o-xylene yield of 94.1%. Despite improving substrate selectivity and yield, implementing multiple microreactor modules prolonged reaction times, reduced production eﬃciency, and increased xed capital costs. Additionally, the double-stage nitration step introduced proce- dural complexity and elevated waste acid generation, which together limited its industrial scalability.37

mononitration selectivity. By optimizing the molar ratio of acid to substrate, the number of microreactor modules was reduced to ve, shortening the reaction time from 90 seconds to 29 seconds. This adjustment signicantly lowered xed costs associated with industrial implementation while enhancing process feasibility. Furthermore, integrating a waste acid recy- cling strategy eﬀectively mitigated the issue of acid disposal. Compared to our previous methodology, this new process ach- ieved notable improvements in product yield and mononitro compound selectivity.

Optimization of nitration in continuous-ow

p-Xylene, an important chemical feedstock,8,38 is widely utilized in the synthesis of dyes, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and pesti- cides. In this study, p-xylene was chosen as a model substrate for optimizing reaction conditions. First, 98% concentrated H2SO4 was diluted with water to the desired concentration and mixed with 97% concentrated HNO3 at a specic molar ratio to prepare the mixed acid. The mixed acid and p-xylene were then fed into a continuous-ow microreactor (Corning AFR Lab reactor equipped with a 2.7 mL microreactor module) through separate inlet streams (Fig. 2). Aer separating the organic phase from the reaction mixture, the products were analyzed via gas chromatography. The eﬀect of temperature on the reaction was rst investi- gated under initial conditions: p-xylene ow rate at 2 g min−1, H2SO4 concentration at 70%, H2SO4/HNO3 molar ratio at 1.2, and HNO3/p-xylene molar ratio at 1.1. Within the temperature range of 30 °C to 100 °C, substrate conversion increased with rising temperature, while mononitration selectivity initially increased and then declined. The highest selectivity was

overabundance of nitronium ions (NO2 +), promoting the formation of unwanted polynitro by-products. Optimization experiments showed that a H2SO4 concentration of 70% provided the best selectivity (Fig. 3c). Despite these optimizations, substrate conversion remained suboptimal, primarily due to the short residence time in the continuous-ow reactor, which limited reaction completion. Increasing the number of microreactor modules to extend the residence time could enhance conversion but would signi- cantly raise the xed investment costs for industrial-scale equipment. To maintain a short reaction time, the reaction was intensied by increasing the molar ratio of HNO3 to

observed at 60 °C (Fig. 3a), with a conversion rate of 46.1% and selectivity of 83.3%. The impact of the H2SO4/HNO3 molar ratio was then examined. Conversion and selectivity improved as the H2SO4/HNO3 ratio increased but declined aer exceeding 2.0. While slightly higher ratios oﬀered marginal improvements, 1.6 was chosen as the optimal ratio for its ability to achieve a good balance between high conversion and selectivity, while mini- mizing the environmental burden associated with excessive acid usage (Fig. 3b). H2SO4 concentration played a critical role in the nitration reaction, functioning as both a catalyst and a dehydrating agent. Insuﬃcient H2SO4 concentration hindered the reaction, while excessive concentrations led to an

Nitro-o-xylene serves as a precursor for the synthesis of important compounds, including riboavin (vitamin B2) and the herbicide dymron, was synthesized using this approach with a yield of 96.1% and a reaction residence time of 19 seconds (Table 1, entry 1). Nitro- chlorobenzene, a key intermediate for azo dyes and herbicides like alachlor, was obtained with a yield of 99.4% within a resi- dence time of 21 seconds (Table 1, entry 2).

Complete substrate conversion was achieved when the molar ratio reached 4.4 (Fig. 3d). Ultimately, under optimized condi- tions—a substrate ow rate of 1 g min−1 and a mixed acid ow rate of 12 g min−1—the yield of mononitro-p-xylene reached 94.0%, with a residence time of only 19 seconds.

properly managed, leads to resource loss and signicant envi- ronmental burdens. Recycling and reusing waste acid, there- fore, oﬀer substantial practical and industrial value. Theoretically, nitration of 1 mol of o-xylene consumes 1 mol of HNO3 and produces an equivalent molar amount of H2O. Based on the initial composition of the mixed acid, the required amounts of supplemental H2SO4 and HNO3 can be calculated. Under optimal reaction conditions, the waste acid is separated and treated, aer which the theoretical amount of H2SO4 is replenished. To account for HNO3 decomposition, 1.2 times the theoretical amount of HNO3 is added. Experimental results conrm that, compared to the standard conditions (Table 2, entry 1), the use of recycled waste acid (Table 2, entry 2) has a negligible impact on reaction outcomes, demonstrating the feasibility and eﬀectiveness of the waste acid recycling strategy.

Compound 5b, a crucial intermediate in the synthesis of Erlotinib, a targeted therapy drug for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer, was also synthesized to further evaluate the versatility of this method (Fig. 4). Under optimized conditions of 30 °C and using dichloromethane (DCM) as the solvent, the substrate achieved complete conversion, resulting in the successful synthesis of 5b. The reaction had a residence time of 65 seconds and an impressive yield of 99.3%, with a product output rate of 34 g h−1.

Scale-up to pilot plant scale

We then performed scale-up experiments for the continuous nitration of o-xylene and p-xylene (using the Corning AFR G1 reactor equipped with ve standard ow control modules, each with a volume of 8.3 mL) (Fig. 5). In these experiments, the feed rate of the substrates was scaled up to 600 g h−1 and the reac- tion residence time was 29 seconds. By ne-tuning the reaction temperature, p-nitroxylene was successfully synthesized at 60 °C with a yield of 94.6% and a product throughput of 809 g h−1. Similarly, the nitration of o-xylene was carried out at 78 °C, achieving a total yield of 97.6% and a throughput of 835 g h−1. Compared to the small-scale process, only minor temperature adjustments were required for the scaled-up throughput, while all other parameters remained unchanged. The yields of the nal products remained stable and even showed slight improvement, highlighting the excellent scalability of the process and its strong potential for industrial applications.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study developed an eﬃcient and safe continuous-ow microreaction mononitration process, achieving high yields and exceptional mononitration selectivity for a variety of mononitro compounds, including nitro-p-xylene, nitro-o-xylene, nitro-chlorobenzene, nitro-toluene, and a key intermediate in the synthesis of the anticancer drug erlotinib. The process was successfully scaled up to a production capacity of 800 g h−1 for the continuous synthesis of nitro-o-xylene and nitro-p-xylene, conrming its scalability and feasibility for industrial implementation. Additionally, the integration of a waste acid recovery and recycling strategy signicantly enhanced economic eﬃciency while mitigating environmental pollution.
