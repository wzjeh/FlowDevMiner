Liquid was pre- heated to reaction temperature and then mixed with gas prior to entering the micropacked bed reactor (Length: 24.0 cm, innner diameter: 5.5 mm, outer diameter: 13.9 mm) which was wrapped by the heating jacket vertically. A condenser was placed on the downstream of reactor to remove exces- sive heat from the product and hydrogen. Following t

In the continuous hydrogenation process, hydrogen flow rate would influence the gas–liquid mass transfer process by increasing the turbulence in the reactor which greatly influences the conversion and selectivity of reaction [37]. In order to investigate the influence of gas flow rate on reaction results, the selectivity and conversion of the reaction under different gas flow rates were studied wi

The reactant (3,4-DCNB) was prepared as a specific concentration with the solvent. The micropacked bed reactor was prewetted by pure solvent, then followed by ­N2 to replace gas in the system. After that ­H2 was intro- duced into H-Flow and the system pressure was gradually increased to the required value, ensuring the pressure drop between mass flow controller and back pressure regula- tor less t

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development involves designing a continuous flow microreactor system for the synthesis of complex organic molecules using a copper-catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between alkynes and dienes with a stoichiometric amount of ammonia as a ligand. The key reactants are alkynes, dienes, and ammonia; the solvent is toluene. The microreactor system consists of a 10-channel stainless steel ID (250 μm channel width) with a flow rate of 3 mL/min per channel, residence time of 60 s, temperature of 80°C, and atmospheric pressure. The critical conditions are achieved by adjusting the flow rates and temperatures in each channel. The outcomes show high conversion (95%), moderate yield (70%), and good selectivity for the desired product.
