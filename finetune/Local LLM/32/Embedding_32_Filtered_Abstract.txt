20 min after the imposed steps giving the system enough time to reach a steady-state, if any. The construction of a microreactor suitable for direct fluorina- tion reactions has several challenges. The microreactor needs to be accurately designed and dimensioned at a microscale level. It must also be constructed by using corrosion resistant materials able to withstand a hostile environment, at ext

without temperature control in the safety vessel, but outside the reactor. This behavior was also confirmed by measuring the temperature increase of the gases in the safety vessel, along with the temperature increase of the tubes connecting the microreactor with the safety vessel. This unstable operative condition was also

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for the continuous production of carbonyl difluoride using fluorine and carbon monoxide as reactants in a microreactor. The solvent is not mentioned, but it is implied that no catalyst is used. The product is carbonyl difluoride with high selectivity. The reactor type is a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) filled with a solvent in the patented flameless approach. Critical conditions include the use of a microreactor, which has a high surface/volume ratio due to the large amount of heat released during the reaction. The flow rate(s), residence time, temperature, and pressure are not specified. However, it is mentioned that the process can be scaled up using arithmetic scaling techniques. The outcome of the process is the production of carbonyl difluoride with high selectivity.

Many attempts to obtain a clean stream of COF2 have been carried out in the past by means of the direct fluorination of carbon monoxide with elemental fluorine or by electrochemical fluorination. The reaction is highly exothermic, therefore difficult to control. It can easily develop into a thermal runaway with a poor selectivity. We have successfully circumvented these critical issues by using a 

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development using a microreactor for the first time with CO as reactant in an F2/CO = 1.22 ratio at various temperatures. Key reactants include F2 and CO; solvent is H2O. Catalyst not mentioned. Product distribution analyzed by GC-TCD, showing different patterns between microreactor (left) and standard reactor (right). Reaction type and critical conditions are unclear due to insufficient information in the given context.

Detailed experiments were performed at constant temperature (18 8C) in both the reactors assembly, standard and microreactor. The carbon monoxide conversion (Fig. 3) is about 30% higher in the microreactor. In both cases the amount of CF3OF produced is linearly proportional to the amount of pure fluorine introduced in the system. However, the amount of trifluoromethyl hypofluorite produced in the

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for the conversion of CO and F2 into desired products using a microreactor with a standard reactor assembly as reference. Key reactants are CO and F2; solvent is not mentioned. Catalyst details are absent. Products are not specified, but they might be the result of the reaction between CO and F2. The reactor type is a microreactor (not ID) and a standard reactor assembly. Critical conditions include varying temperature at constant stoichiometry (F2/CO = 1.22), with no mention of flow rates, residence times, or pressure. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show IR absorbance ratios for the tests performed. The outcomes are not explicitly stated but might be inferred from the figures.

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for COF2 synthesis using F2 as the reactive species. The reaction is performed at constant stoichiometry (F2/CO = 1.22) in both standard and microreactor assemblies, with varying temperatures. The concentration of COF2 is measured based on area basis. The key reactants are CO and F2, while the solvent and catalyst are not mentioned. The products are COF2 and unreacted starting materials. The reactor details include standard and microreactor assemblies with dashed and continuous lines representing different temperature conditions. Critical conditions such as flow rates, residence times, temperatures, and pressures are not specified in the given context. Outcomes like conversion, yield, and selectivity are also absent from the provided information.
