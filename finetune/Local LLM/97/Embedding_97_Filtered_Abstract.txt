Summary: The paragraph discusses a flow-chemistry process development for the diazotization reaction of 4-NBDT in a microreactor system. The key reactants are not mentioned, but the products are 4-NBDT and other unspecified byproducts. The reactor type is a T-micromixer followed by a capillary. The critical conditions include total volumetric flow rate (2 mL/min), residence time, temperature, and pressure, which are not specified. The outcome is the yield of 4-NBDT, which remains constant for various volumetric flow rates from 2 to 15 mL/min, indicating excellent mixing performance and fast enough diazotization under the involved experimental conditions.

homogeneous Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. [19, 20] Ionic liquid (IL) was used to transform the heterogeneous Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction to a homogeneous state and implemented in a continuous-flow microreactor sys- tem. [21] Due to the better mixing performance of microreactor, the yield and selectivity were improved than the batch reactor. Next, a droplet-based microreactor 

The schematic overview of the capillary microreactor system is shown in Fig. 1. Twosteps, namely the diazotization and the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, were operated sepa- rately in this work. In the diazotization step synthesizing 4- NBDT, Solution A was prepared by dissolving PNA and HBF4 in MeCN with the fixed PNA concentration of 0.81 mol/L, while Solution B consisted of NaNO2, s- t

In short, the microreactor shows ex- cellent application potential for both the diazotization and the following Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. Nevertheless, there are still lots of work to be done in the future such as combining these two st
