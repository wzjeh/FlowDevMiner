  "reaction_summary": {
    "reaction_type": "",
    "reactants": [],
    "products": [],

Step 1: Analyze the problem
The task is to extract the optimal condition set from abstracts and output a JSON object. The input data consists of multiple abstracts, each describing a flow-chemistry process development in microreactors for polymerization reactions.

### Step 2: Outline the solution strategy

To solve this problem, we will:

1. Read all the abstracts.
2. Extract relevant information from each abstract (reaction type, reactants, products, conditions, reactor details, and metrics).
3. Identify the optimal condition set based on yield/conversion values.

### Step 3: Implement data extraction
python
import json

# Define a function to extract relevant information from an abstract

    reaction_summary = {

    if "polymerization" in abstract:
        reaction_summary["reaction_type"] = "Polymerization"

        reaction_summary["reaction_type"] = "Hydrogenation"

    # Extract conditions (temperature, residence time, pressure)

        if "°C" in line or "min" in line or "MPa" in line:

                condition["type"] = "temperature"
                condition["value"] = float(line.split(" ")[0])
            elif "min" in line:
                condition["type"] = "residence_time"
                condition["value"] = int(line.split(" ")[0])
            else:  # MPa
                condition["type"] = "pressure"
                condition["value"] = float(line.split(" ")[0])
            reaction_summary["conditions"].append(condition)

    return reaction_summary

        info = extract_info(abstract)
        if "metrics" not in info or len(info["conditions"]) == 0:
            continue
        
        # Find the condition with highest yield/conversion value
        max_yield = float('inf')
        max_conversion = float('-inf')

        for metric in ["yield", "conversion"]:
            if metric in info["metrics"] and isinstance(info["metrics"][metric], (int, float)):
                val = info["metrics"][metric]
                if metric == "yield":
                    max_yield = min(max_yield, val)
                else:
                    max_conversion = max(max_conversion, val)

        # Update optimal conditions
        if max_yield > best_yield or (max_yield == best_yield and max_conversion > best_conversion):
            best_yield = max_yield
