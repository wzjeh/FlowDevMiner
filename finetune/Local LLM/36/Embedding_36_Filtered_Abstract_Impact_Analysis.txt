# Influence Factor Summary

| Factor | Metric | Direction |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1. residence_time | conversion of TFMB | increase |
| residence_time | product selectivity | decrease |
| 2. gas_flow_rate | WeGS | decrease |
| liquid_flow_rate | liquid film thickness | increase |
| gas_flow_rate, liquid_flow_rate | ratio between them | decrease |
| residence_time | residence time | increase |
| 3. MBY concentration | selectivity over Pd/TiO2 | increase |
| MBY concentration | effect of higher selectivity over other catalysts | - |
| pattern = r"(\w+)\s+is\s+(an?\s*\w*)\s*(increase | decrease | unchanged |
