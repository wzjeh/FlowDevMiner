materials and final product and the same productivity, the volume of the reaction mixture in a batch reactor is several orders of magnitude higher than in a flow reactor [5]. The minimum amount of the reaction mixture in the reactor minimizes the explosion hazard of exothermic reactions. In addition to process safety, a significant reduction in the amount of reagents plays a significant role in solving environmental concerns [6]. More accurate control of reactions in a continuous flow mode minimizes the amount of by-products. One of the key advantages of continuous flow reactor technology is the accuracy of scaling and numbering. Due to the high speed and precision of changing the reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, flow rates, reagent ratio, use of catalysts, etc.) microreactor systems are an ideal tool for efficient and fast optimization of reactions [7]. Microfluidic technologies have been recently proposed to improve the fine chemistry processes. Selective hydrogenation of MBY in methanol has been previously studied in the capillary microreactors with diameter 220 μm the inner surface of which was covered with Pd25Zn75/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 [8]. Capillary microreactors allowed overcoming the mass transfer limitation and to improve the selectivity to the desired product by precise control of the liquid residence time [9–12]. To perform hydrogenations in a microreactor, titania films can be recently prepared via evaporation induced self-assembly [8,9]. A limitation of the use of pure titanium dioxide materials is that they are very sensitive to moisture and have poor thermal stability at high pre-treatment temperatures. This drawback does not exist in the case of multicrystalline, mesoporous ordered materials [13]. Recently, the use of mixed metal oxide systems has been highlighted to improve the stability and/or surface properties of mesoporous oxides [14–16]. When using Ce-doped coatings, the shortcomings of titanium systems can be overcome due to the increased chemical and thermal stability of the coating [17]. In this article we present the continuous selective hydrogenation of MBY in capillary microreactors to provide greater control over the chemical process than classical batch and semi-continuous technologies and to improve the environmental per­ formance of the process. The reaction was optimized with respect of the activity, selectivity to 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBE) and stability for one of the three catalysts Pd/Ti0.95Ce0.05O2, Pd80Zn20/Ti0.95­ Ce0.05O2, Pd/TiO2. Pd was chosen for its high activity. Secondary metals are often included in a catalyst to increase the selectivity to MBE [18–21]. Recent studies have analyzed the possibility of using inter­ metallic PdZn nanoparticles with electronic properties different from those of the parent Pd metal [8,9,22,23].

(capillary) reactors and standard volumetric ones is the laminar flow of fluids (liquids and gases). The use of capillaries provides almost perfect mixing of reagents due to diffusion. Ideal diffusion mixing pre­ determines the high selectivity and purity of the reaction, and, as a consequence, a significant reduction in the formation of by-products and intermediate products [3]. The ratio of the contact area to the volume of the reaction mixture of microreactors is many times greater than the contact area in bulk reactors [4]. The most efficient heat exchange al­ lows for instant heating and cooling of the reaction mixtures, main­ taining isothermal reaction conditions at all points in the system. The micro-sizes of the capillaries allow the use of such reactors for opera­ tion under high pressure. All of the above factors - contact area, heat exchange, temperature, pressure - determine the kinetics of reactions. The advantages of microstructure reactors lead to a significant reduction in reaction times, ultimately predetermining higher productivity of continuous flow reactors compared to traditional bulk reactors. One of the decisive aspects of modern chemistry is the safety of reactions and processes. It is easy to calculate that with an equal amount of starting

The performance of a microcapillary reactor was compared to that of a batch type reactor (Table 1). A significant difference was obtained in the selectivity. Higher selectivity in the microcapillary reactor can be achieved through precise control of the reagent residence time. An in­ crease in the residence time results in a loss of selectivity due to the complete hydrogenation of the MBE. Selectivity to MBE at 86 % con­ version decreased from 91 % to 79 % with a decrease in the H2 flow rate

from 4 ml/min to 1 ml/min. The hydrogen flow rate was 25 times greater than the liquid velocity, providing a 5:1 M ratio of hydrogen to the substrate and full hydrogenation even at lower gas flow rates. Gas and liquid flow rates have the main effect on the structure of the two phase flow, setting the flow regime (slug flow and annular flow). For round pipes, it is advisable to use the ratios of inertial and capillary forces in the form of Weber numbers calculated from the superficial velocities of gas and liquid [30]. The Weber number is defined as:

CMBY,0 х100; where CMBY,0 is the initial concentration of MBY; CMBY and CMBE are current concentrations of MBY and MBE, respectively; V is the reaction volume; vl liquid flow rate, t is the current reaction time in

defined as A = (CMBY,0−CMBY)×V t×molPd × 100; activity in microcapillary reactor

At a low gas flow rate (1 ml/min), the value of WeGS (13) exceeds the value of 11.0 × W0.14 LS (8.5), even at a high liquid flow rate (40 μl/min). The range of the applied gas and liquid flow rates corresponds to the annular flow regime. As a result of the decreased ratio between the gas and liquid flow rates, the liquid film flowing along the channel walls becomes thicker, which results in a longer liquid residence time in the reactor. This decreases the selectivity towards the partially hydroge­ nated product because at a higher liquid residence time the subsequent hydrogenation of MBE occurs. The selectivity to MBE is higher than that observed in a batch reactor at a hydrogen flow rate of 2 ml/min.

2.2.2. Continuous capillary reactor The coatings on the inner surface of the silica capillary were tested in the setup presented in Fig. 1 at the temperature range from 303 to 333 K. The setup consisted of a continuous flow syringe pump, hydrogen and helium mass flow controllers, connected to the reactor by tubes (250 μm in diameter) and thermostatic oven. The coating on the inner surface of the silica capillary was preliminarily washed by withdrawing 50 mL of methanol and reduced with hydrogen at 573 K. A gas consisting of a hydrogen/helium mixture and a solution of MBY and 1-butanol in methanol were mixed in a T-mixer. Five reaction parameters were varied: MBY concentration between 0.04 and 0.3 M, H2 partial pressure from 0.3 to 1, liquid flow between 5 and 60 μL/min, the H2/He flow between 0.1 and 4.0 mL/min (STP), temperature form 303 to 333 K. The MBY solution and hydrogen were continuously flowing through the reactor within 10–30 min, then 3 liquid samples were collected, diluted 3:1 with methanol and analyzed using a gas chromatograph Crystall 2000 M equipped with an SKTFT-50X capillary column (diameter: 0.22 mm, length: 30 m) and a FID detector.

on stream in terms of activity and selectivity at >97 % conversion (Fig.11) and conversion and selectivity at a constant liquid flow rate (Fig. 12). Our results showed that the MBY (1.0 M) conversion increases from 36.6 % to 99.4 % at a liquid flow rate of 0.03 mL/min during 20 h on stream due to cleaning the active surface from carbonaceous deposits [22]. Increasing run time from 20 h to 68 h increased selectivity from 93.5% to 96.5% at nearly 100 % conversion (Fig. 11b). The best MBE yield of 95.8 % at 99 % conversion was obtained after 68 h on stream (Fig. 11a). The Pd50Zn50/Ti0.95Ce0.05O2 coating exhibited better activity and selectivity in comparison with reported earlier (Table 5), so high liquid product yields can be achieved and there is a large potential for realization of this technology on an industrial scale. Constant MBE selectivity of 96–97 % was observed in the next 70 h of operation (Fig. 12). MBY conversion decreased from 100 to 83 % during 138 h on stream. A negative result of metal leaching was obtained when analyzing the resulting product solution after 138 h on stream which is consistent with previous research [60]. Since the deactivation rate was found to be 8 % of the initial activity per day (Fig. 11a), the hydroge­ nation reaction was performed over the Pd50Zn50/Ti0.95Ce0.05O2-2 reduced in hydrogen at 573 K for 2 h after 138 h on stream (Fig. 13). Reduction recovered the initial activity of the catalyst. Thus, it can be concluded that the decrease in activity in the period from 20 to 138 h on stream can be explained by the destruction of the active center as a result of the Ce3+ - Ce4+ oxidation. Calcination at 573 K (treatment 3) did not affect selectivity to MBE (Figs. 12 and 13), decreased activity by 2.8 times (Fig. 13) and reduced conversion from 100 % to 61 % (Fig. 12). Within the next 152 h activity gradually decreased from 0.77 to 0.66 mol/molPd/s (Fig. 11a), and selectivity remained constant
