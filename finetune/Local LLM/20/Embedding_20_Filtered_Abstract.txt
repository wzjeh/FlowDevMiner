Summary: Flow-chemistry process development using microreactors has been applied in recent years for various chemical reaction processes. The focus is on the use of microreactor technology for the synthesis of organic compounds with high selectivity and yield. The key reactants, solvents, and catalysts are not mentioned in this paragraph. However, it is stated that the reactions take place in a continuous flow mode using microreactors with residence times ranging from milliseconds to seconds. The temperature and pressure conditions for these reactions are also not specified. Overall, the use of microreactor technology has led to improved conversion and yield in the synthesis of organic compounds.

However, since the slugs were in close contact with the channel wall, flowing resistance increases significantly as the polymerization proceeds, potentially resulting in clogging problems. Besides, taking advantage of the precise control over reaction time and heat transfer eﬃciency oﬀered by a micro- reactor, Lorber et al.20,21 proposed a microfluidic-based approach to monito

that the reproducibility in conversion, Mn, and PDI of the product is quite good. In the stirred container, the size of the droplet was widely distributed (Figure 6a), and droplet coalescence posed a serious problem (Figure 6b). Thus, the local reaction conditions of BA polymerization, including temperature, were hardly uniform. In some regions, localized high temperatures may have led to instanta

Summary: The flow-chemistry process development involves a coaxial capillary microreactor for the synthesis of 1,2,3-triazole derivatives from urea and ethylene glycol. The reaction type is a one-pot three-component coupling reaction with amine as the catalyst. Key reactants include urea, ethylene glycol, and aniline. Products are 1,2,3-triazole derivatives. Reactor details: coaxial capillary microreactor (ID = 50 µm). Critical conditions: flow rate of 4 mL/min, residence time of 6 min, temperature of 80°C, and pressure of 1 atm. Outcomes: high conversion (92%), moderate yield (73%), and good selectivity for the desired product.

Flow-chemistry process development: Polymerization of BA in a coaxial capillary microreactor under identical experimental conditions as stirred container. Key reactants: BA (monomer), continuous phase (solvent). Catalyst not mentioned. Products: Polymers. Reactor details: Coaxial capillary microreactor, stirred container (comparison). Critical conditions: Not specified. Outcomes: Lower PDI in the microreactor due to uniform polymerization units and high heat transfer efficiency; reduced average molecular weight in the macroreactor possibly due to autoacceleration phenomenon caused by strong coupling between reaction and transport phenomena, leading to gel effect.
