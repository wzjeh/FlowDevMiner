- Temperature is in °C; residence_time is in min; flow_rate is in mL/min; inner_diameter is in mm.

Flow rate 0.1 mL/min, T=80 °C in a 0.5 mm coil; yield 82%.
phase was extracted in diethyl ether and the samples were subjected to analysis.
The reaction composition was varied by changing the flow ratio at the inlet and the composition of the nitrating mixture,
while the temperature was changed by changing the bulk temperature in the thermostat.

Flow rate 0.2 mL/min, T=90 °C; yield 85%.
phase was extracted in diethyl ether and the samples were subjected to analysis.
The reaction composition was varied by changing the flow ratio at the inlet and the composition of the nitrating mixture,
while the temperature was changed by changing the bulk temperature in the thermostat.

Flow rate 0.3 mL/min, T=100 °C; yield 88%.
phase was extracted in diethyl ether and the samples were subjected to analysis.
