Introduction Microreactors are being used for several fast and exothermic reactions, and a vast amount of information on the feasibility of many homonegeous and heterogeneous reactions in miniatur- ized devices is reported in the literature.1-4 A few of the important advantages of microreactors are: (i) very high heat transfer area, which helps carry out exothermic reactions, (ii) smaller residenc

Flow-chemistry process development: Nitrobenzaldehyde synthesis using continuous flow system with nitric acid as the nitrating agent. Key reactants are benzaldehyde and nitric acid (3.5:1 mol/mol ratio). Sulfuric acid is used as a catalyst, and the product is nitrobenzaldehyde. The reactor type is continuous flow with an ID of 2 mm. Critical conditions include a fixed residence time of 60 minutes at 5 °C, and a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Outcomes are not mentioned in this context.

Thus, having a suitable micromixer would help to eliminate the residence time tube, thereby opening several options for scaling up the miniaturized system for this reaction. It will also be useful to design an inline separator (L-L extractor) for the separation of the two isomers. Thus, this work demonstrates that the nitration of benzal- dehyde can be carried out in a safe manner in continuous mo

Flow-chemistry process development: Nitric acid catalyzed benzaldehyde oxidation. Key reactants: nitric acid (HNO3) and benzaldehyde (BA). Products: benzoic acid (BA), hydroxylamine (NHOH), and water (H2O). Reactor details: continuous flow system, 5 °C temperature. Critical conditions: mole ratio of nitric acid to benzaldehyde at the inlet varies from 0.1 to 3. Outcomes: effect on product composition analyzed by varying HNO3: BA mole ratio.

phase was extracted in diethyl ether and the samples were subjected to analysis. The reaction composition was varied by changing the flow ratio at the inlet and the composition of the nitrating mixture, while the temperature was changed by changing the bulk temperature in the thermostat.

Experimental Section In the batch mode, the nitrating mixture was prepared by stirring concentrated sulfuric acid with nitric acid (70%, sp. gr. 1.42), with sufficient cooling by an ice bath. The reaction was carried out in a glass jacketed reactor (50 mL), and the temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained by circulat- ing water from a thermostat (Julabo, Germany). Benzaldehyde was added 

The nitration of benzaldehyde can be carried out in a safe manner in continuous mode using a microreactor system. Choice of a micromixer was seen to affect the performance of this two-phase reaction significantly. The reaction time could be brought down to 2 min by increasing the reaction temperature and thereby taking advantage of higher heat transfer area. The simple T-micromixer is seen to be i

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for continuous nitration of benzaldehyde using a microreactor with a packed-bed catalyst. Key reactants include benzaldehyde and concentrated HNO3, while the solvent is cyclohexane. The reactor type is a 10 mm ID stainless steel microreactor with a packed bed of Amberlyst-74 as the catalyst. Critical conditions are: flow rate = 2 mL/min (benzaldehyde), residence time = 6 min, temperature = 50°C, and pressure = atmospheric pressure. The product is p-nitrobenzaldehyde with a conversion of 98% and selectivity of 97%.

further experiments were carried out to realize the effect of temperature on the reaction and outlet composition. The experiments were carried out at three different temper- atures, 5, 15, and 25 °C. The observations are shown in Figure 4. As expected, with an increase in the reaction temperature, the time required for completion of the nitration reaction decreased significantly. Although at lower
