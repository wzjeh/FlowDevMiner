Input
The study focuses on a flow-chemistry process development for the conversion of 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) to ethylhydroquinone (EHN). The reaction was carried out at varying temperatures between 80 °C and 120 °C, with residence times ranging from 10 min to 30 min. A microreactor with an inner diameter of 1 mm was used for the experiments. The flow rate of reactant A (2-EH) was maintained constant at 0.6 mL/min, while that of reactant B (water) varied between 0.05 and 0.15 mL/min. The total flow rate ranged from 0.65 to 1.75 mL/min. The M-ratio was kept at a value of 1.26 throughout the experiments.

The reaction conditions were optimized for maximum yield, with an optimal temperature of 100 °C, residence time of 20 min, and reactant B flow rate of 0.10 mL/min resulting in a total flow rate of 0.70 mL/min. The pressure was maintained at atmospheric level (1013 mbar). Under these conditions,

Step 1: Preprocess the input string to extract relevant information




    # Extract temperature and residence time (if present)
    temp_match = re.search(r'(\d+) °C', input_str)
    if temp_match:
        temp_value = int(temp_match.group(1))
    
    res_time_match = re.search(r'residence time (\d+)', input_str, re.IGNORECASE)
    if res_time_match:
        res_time_value = float(res_time_match.group(1))

    # Extract flow rates (if present) and determine total flow rate
    flow_rate_matches = re.findall(r'(\d+(?:\.\d+)?) mL/min', input_str)
    flow_rates = [float(rate) for rate in flow_rate_matches]
    
    if len(flow_rates) == 1:
        total_flow_rate = flow_rates[0]
    elif len(flow_rates) > 1 and 'mixed acid' not in input_str.lower():
        # If mixed acid is present, assume it's fed by dropping into the reactant
        total_flow_rate = max(flow_rates)
