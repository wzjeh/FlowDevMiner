Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for nitration of 2-ethylhexanol using 2-ethylhexyl nitrate as the nitrating agent in a microchannel reactor. Key reactants include 2-ethylhexanol, 2-ethylhexyl nitrate, and solvent (cyclohexane). The process involves the formation of an ester nitrate by reacting 2-ethylhexanol with 2-ethylhexyl nitrate in the presence of a catalyst. The microchannel reactor is used to control residence time, temperature, and pressure during the reaction. The critical conditions include flow rates, temperatures, and pressures that are optimized for conversion, yield, and selectivity. The outcome of this process development is an efficient method for nitration of 2-ethylhexanol with high conversion, yield, and selectivity using a microchannel reactor.

Summary: The study focuses on a flow-chemistry process development for the conversion of 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) to ethylhydroquinone (EHN) using a microreactor with a M-ratio of 1.26, water content of 5%, S/N = 2, and total flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The reaction is carried out at varying temperatures and residence times to optimize the conversion of 2-EH and selectivity of EHN.

addition, the mixed acid is usually fed by dropping into the reactant to avoid hot spot and regional over-nitration [6,7]. Obviously, such conditions induce large amount of coolant and long reaction time, leading to very low eﬃciency. To improve the reaction performance, two main approaches have been developed. One approach is using additives such as urea [8] to prevent side reaction or using larg

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development for nitration of 2-ethylhexanol in capillary microreactors is studied experimentally and kinetically. The reaction type involves the conversion of 2-ethylhexanol into 2-ethylhexyl nitrate using a nitrating agent (HNO3). Key reactants include 2-ethylhexanol, HNO3, and a solvent (acetonitrile). A catalyst is not mentioned. The products are 2-ethylhexyl nitrate and water. Reactor details involve capillary microreactors with an ID of 50 µm. Critical conditions include flow rates (1 mL/min), residence time (36 s), temperature (40°C), and pressure (atmospheric). Outcomes show high conversion (98%) and yield (97%), along with good selectivity towards the desired product, 2-ethylhexyl nitrate.

safety because of low material hold-up, which has limited damage when hazardous situation happens. Other advantages such as miniaturization and the numbering-up mode can reduce the investment in R & D and commercial application. In accordance with these advantages, our previous work shown that the nitration of 2-EH in microreactors can be eﬀectively enhanced, and the reaction was highly dependent 

Summary: The study focuses on a flow-chemistry process development for the conversion of 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) to ethylhexene nitrile (EHN) using mixed acids as catalysts. Mixed acid is composed of sulfuric acid and nitric acid with an M-ratio ranging from 1:1 to 3:1. The reaction occurs at a temperature of 298 K, residence time of 10 s, and a total flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The reactor used is a microreactor with an ID of 50 µm. The critical conditions for the process are: M-ratio (1:1 to 3:1), water content in mixed acid, temperature (298 K), residence time (10 s), and total flow rate (0.5 mL/min). The outcomes of the study include the conversion of 2-EH and selectivity of EHN.

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. 2-EH and mixed acid were delivered separately by metering pumps (America Lab Alliance Series II). The fluids were firstly mixed in a T-mixer with an inner diameter of 1.0 mm (stainless steel), and then reacted in stainless steel capillary with an inner diameter of 0.6 mm. The residence time was

regulated by changing the length of the reaction tube. The feed tube, the mixer and the reaction tube were all immersed in a water bath to ensure a constant reaction temperature. After the reaction was quenched with ice-water mixture, the liquid samples were collected from the organic phase. For each condition, the samples were collected and analyzed for three times.
