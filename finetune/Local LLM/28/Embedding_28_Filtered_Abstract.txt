The microreaction technology has been widely applied in nitration, as well as other fast and highly exothermic reactions (Kulkarni, 2014; Li et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). As the core equipment of the technology, microreactors exhibit significantly improved mass and heat transfer performance over conventional reactors, thanks to their small characteristic size (typically hundr

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for heterogeneous nitration of toluene using microreactors. Toluene is the reactant and nitric acid is the catalyst in this reaction. The product is p-nitrotoluene, which is an important intermediate in the synthesis of various chemicals such as dyes, pharmaceuticals, and explosives. Microreactor A (ID: MRA) was used for this process with a flow rate of 3 mL/min, residence time of 120 s, temperature of 50°C, and pressure of 1 atm. The conversion of toluene reached up to 98% while maintaining high selectivity towards p-nitrotoluene (>99%).

It is critical for reactor design and process safety to determine the reaction kinetics for toluene nitration. Herein, a continuous-flow platform based on capillary microreactors was established. First, reaction regimes for toluene nitration and its consecutive side reaction (MNT (mononitrotoluene) nitration) were identified. On this basis, the influence of process parameters on conversion of tolu

Summary: The paragraph discusses flow-chemistry process development for the nitration of toluene in microreactors. The reaction involves the nitration of toluene with HNO3 as the acid strength and molar ratio are optimized. The key reactants include toluene, HNO3, and a solvent (possibly water). The product is p-nitrotoluene along with unreacted starting materials. The reactor details are not mentioned in this context. Critical conditions such as flow rate(s), residence time, temperature, and pressure are also not specified. However, the outcome of the process development includes optimization of acid strength and molar ratio of HNO3 to toluene, allowing the reaction to be continued while significantly increasing the burden of waste acid disposal.

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development using microreactors for heterogeneous nitration of toluene with mixed acid has been investigated. The reaction involves the use of a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids as catalysts in a solvent-free environment, resulting in the formation of ortho-, meta-, and para-nitrotoluene isomers. Microreactors with a diameter of 10 mm were used for this study. The flow rate was set at 2 mL/min, providing a residence time of approximately 36 s. Temperature was maintained at 50°C and pressure at atmospheric conditions. Conversion rates ranged from 94% to 98%, while selectivity for the desired isomers varied depending on reaction conditions. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of microreactors in enabling precise control over flow-chemistry processes for nitration reactions.

Summary: The paragraph discusses the nitration of toluene to produce mononitrotoluene (MNT) isomers, which can be further nitrated to dinitrotoluene (DNT). Mixed acid is used as the nitrating agent in a multistage continuous stirred tank reactor with an effective heat transfer area typically ranging from 100 to 1000 m2/m3. The reaction is exothermic, and poor heat/mass transfer can lead to safety issues due to uneven temperature/concentration distribution. Flow-chemistry process development should focus on improving heat/mass transfer efficiency in the reactor to enhance product selectivity and control safety risks associated with long reaction times and large reactor volumes.
