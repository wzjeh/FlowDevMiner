Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of flow-chemistry processes for nitration reactions using microreactors with microchannels. Key reactants include organic substrates and nitrating agents like concentrated HNO3 or NO2-. Catalysts can be used to control reaction rates, selectivity, and improve conversion/yield. Microreactor types include co-flow (parallel or countercurrent), serial, and mixer-settler configurations. Critical conditions depend on the specific nitration process but typically involve residence times between 10^-6 and 10^2 s at temperatures below 80°C and atmospheric pressure. Outcomes include high conversion/yield/selectivity for various nitro compounds, enabling rapid scale-up to industrial production levels with minimal waste generation.

Summary: The paragraph discusses the scaling-up of droplet-based microreactors for nitration reactions with varying channel diameters while maintaining constant residence time and total flow rate. The reaction involves etherate as a reactant in the presence of a catalyst at 298 K, producing undisclosed products. Three microchannel diameters (0.5, 1.0, and 1.59 mm) were investigated, with conversion decreasing slightly from 80% to 75.5% due to changes in flow dynamics and increased coalescence of droplets. The reactor type is a microchannel with an inner diameter ranging from 0.5 to 1.59 mm, and the critical conditions include constant residence time (333.5 s) and total flow rate (142 lL⁻¹min⁻¹).

The microreactor consisted mainly of a FEP T-mixer (i.d. 0.5 mm, IDEX Health & Science), two inlet PTFE tubes with suffi- cient length for preheating (i.d. 0.5 mm, length 1 m, IDEX Health & Science), and a main reaction circular PTFE channel with selected inner diameter and length (i.d. 0.5, 1.0, or 1.59 mm; length 0.4– 8 m; Nichias Corporation). The microreactor and overall experi- mental setup i

Flow-chemistry process development: Nitration reaction of an organic compound in a droplet-based microfluidic reactor using acid as the nitrating agent. Key reactants include the organic compound and acid; solvent is not mentioned. Products are the nitroated organic compounds. Reactor type: Droplet-based microfluidic (not specified). Critical conditions: Total flow rate, residence time, temperature, pressure - not explicitly stated in this context. Outcomes: Conversion and selectivity of the reaction were observed; however, the effect of total flow rate on these outcomes was insignificant under the given experimental conditions, suggesting a wide operating zone for this process.

was able to give a fourfold increase in total volumetric flow rate when the reactor channel diameter was doubled (from 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm).

By varying total flow rate and flow rate ratio, stable and control- lable droplet-based multiphase microfluidics was achieved, as shown in Fig. 2. Regular droplets were generated of aqueous phase mixed acid which were suspended in the continuous organic phase composed of mainly 1,2-dichloroethane as main carrier, and reac- tant 3-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy] benzoic acid (or etherate) wh

Summary: The paragraph discusses a flow-chemistry process development for liquid–liquid two-phase hydrogenation reactions in a droplet-based reactor. The reaction involves an organic substrate and hydrogen gas as reactants, with water as the solvent/catalyst. The products are the desired organic product and water. The reactor is a main reaction tube with a constant diameter. Critical conditions include varying total flow rates (200–1200 l Lmin1), constant residence time (83 s), and remaining N/S, M-ratio, organic phase concentration, and reaction temperature all as constant. The reactant conversion and product selectivity are observed to vary with the total flow rate. Conversion increases slightly from 65% to 67% in the low total flow rate range (<426 lLmin1), then decreases slightly from 67% to 61% when the total flow rate is increased from 426 lLmin1 to 580 lLmin1. As the total flow rate increases further, a slight recovery of conversion is found, from 61% to 64%, up to 1200 lLmin1.

(1) Increasing reaction temperature and M-ratio results in over- all higher reaction rate and conversion, and simultaneously increase in side reaction rate leading to the reduction of pro- duct selectivity, while increasing N/S reduces the conversion but has insignificant effect on product selectivity. The opti- mized reaction temperature, M-ratio and N/S are found to be 308 K, 1.6 and 0.57, respe

The submillimeter microscale continuous flow process is particu- larly of significance to fast exothermic and complex reactions, such as polymerization and radical reactions involving unstable inter- mediates or toxic reagents (Kim et al., 2004; Zaborenko et al., 2010). In our series of studies on microreactor technology, we have successfully developed a range of droplet-based microreactors, demon
