a. Catalyst preparation: An IKA mill was used for the reduc-
tion of the catalysts particle size. Once powdered the
catalysts were sieved with a 75-mm sieve.
b. Microreactor preparation: The microreactors were intro-
duced in an ultrasonic bath with isopropanol during 10 min
for channel cleaning. After drying, they were calcined at
1273 K during 4 h.
c. Catalyst impregnation: A liquid phase suspension of the
catalyst was prepared by dissolving a certain amount of it
in water and then adding an organic solvent (e.g., ethanol)
to form a homogeneous solution.

d. Reaction conditions:
The reaction mixture consisted of reactant A, reactant B,
and catalyst C in a 1:2:0.5 molar ratio.
Flow rate was set to 10 mL/min for both reactants and
catalyst.
Temperature was maintained at 80 °C during the reac-
tion.

e. Reaction products:
The reaction produced product P with an optimal yield of
95%.

f. Residence time:
Residence time was varied
