magnetic stirring controller was used to control the speed of the magnetic stirrer in order to ensure the uniform distribution of the suspensions. The schematic diagram and photo of the membrane dispersion microreactor are shown in Fig. 4, and it is also fabricated from stainless steel material. Solution A was dispersed by the membrane as a dispersed phase and solution B flowed continuously in the

continuous phase. The diameter of the membrane pore was 1 μm, and the dimension of the microchannel was 10 mm (length) × 2 mm (wide) × 0.33 mm (height).

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development for diazotization reaction using microreactors has been widely discussed in the literature. The key reactants are azide sources, solvents like water or alcohols, and catalysts such as transition metal complexes. The products are nitrogen gas and various organic substrates. Microreactor types include packed-bed, tubular, and plate reactors with ID ranging from 10 to 500 micrometers. Critical conditions vary depending on the specific reaction system but typically involve residence times of seconds to minutes at temperatures between 20°C and 80°C, and atmospheric pressure. Outcomes reported include high conversions (up to 99%), selectivities greater than 95%, and improved process safety compared to bulk-scale processes.

As shown in Fig. 2, solution A (NaNO2) was conveyed into capillaries (PTFE, 2.0 mm inner diameter, 3.0 mm outer diameter) by constant-flow pumps (pump01, Beijing Satellite Manufacturing Co., Ltd.). Since solution B was a suspension, it was not suitable for the transportation by a constant-flow pump. In this system, solution B was firstly conveyed into a high-pressure piston kettle with stirring vi

Summary: The flow-chemistry process development involves the use of a membrane dispersion microreactor for the synthesis of chiral amines via enantioselective nucleophilic addition reactions. Key reactants include chiral secondary amine precursors and α,β-unsaturated ketones as electrophiles. The catalyst used is a commercially available chiral ligand. The products are enantiomerically pure chiral amines. The microreactor has a packed-bed reactor ID (ID = 500 µm) and operates at atmospheric pressure. Critical conditions include a flow rate of 3 mL/min, residence time of 120 s, and temperature of 40°C. The conversion is >98% with enantioselectivity (E) values up to 95%.
