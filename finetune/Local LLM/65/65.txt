Abstract In this paper, a micro-fluidic optimized process for the continuous flow synthesis of azo compounds is presented. The continuous flow synthesis of Sudan II azo dye was used as a model reaction for the study. At found optimal azo coupling reaction temperature and pH an investigation of the optimum flow rates of the reactants for the diazotization and azo coupling reactions in Little Things Factory-MS microreactors was performed. A conversion of 98% was achieved in approximately 2.4 minutes and a small library of azo compounds was thus generated under these reaction conditions from couplers with aminated or hydroxylated aromatic systems. The scaled up synthesis of these compounds in PTFE tubing (i.d. 1.5 mm) was also investigated, where good reaction conversions ranging between 66–91% were attained.

Introduction Going green, a familiar catch phrase in the chemical industry, in addition to environment protection laws have influenced and also triggered the development of cleaner methods of produc- tion. The production of azo compounds is one controversial sector of the fine chemical industry; color is highly desired and used in almost everything, but the waste generated from the

production of these compounds is detrimental to the environ- ment and human health.

Following the principles of green chemistry [1,2] such as less hazardous chemical synthesis, efficient atom economy, reduc- tion of waste produced, some alternative cleaner methods for

the synthesis of azo dyes have been developed. These methods are however only representative of particular coupling agents and diazotized amines. Nonetheless they highlight the green benefits that they offer.

room temperature even in their dry state. In addition, the method also facilitated short reaction times and provided high yields (Scheme 3).

A number of other methods have been developed for the green synthesis of azo compounds [6-16]. Thus far, the above exam- ples concentrate on modifying the procedure of diazotization and azo coupling (using compounds that impart green benefits to the process or make it environment friendly, i.e., short reac- tion times thus less energy is required for the process, high yield thus low amount of waste generated, etc). Equally, process equipment can also be changed or modified to achieve the above mentioned green benefits in addition to other advantages.

For example Noroozi-Pesyan et al. synthesized azo dyes by grinding derivatives of aniline with solid sodium nitrite in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid [3]. It was found that the yield of isolated azo dyes obtained increased with an increase in electron donor strength of the coupling compound. This method eliminates the use of alkaline and acidic solutions (Scheme 1).

In another method developed by Rahimizadeh et al., ferric hydrogen sulfate was used as a catalyst to synthesize azo com- pounds from aromatic amines and 2-naphthol. The method boasts of shorter reaction times [4] with high yields (Scheme 2).

For example, isolated diazonium salts are known to be hazardous due to their explosive and unstable nature. However, microreactor technology makes it possible to safely perform reactions with unstable intermediates [17] such as these, as well as those that give rise to explosive [18] and hazardous products [19]. The small reagent volumes used in microreactors also

Mirjalili et al. also used silica supported boron trifluoride and was able to carry out diazotization at room temperature [5] after they discovered that the diazonium salts obtained were stable at

solved in the organic phase, ethyl acetate (C4H8O2) and 11 in the aqueous phase (Scheme 4). The large specific interfacial areas and reduced molecular diffusion distances were found to have played a role in avoiding the undesirable side reaction, thus increasing the atom economy in the reaction. This in turn reduces the amount of waste generated after the reaction. A reaction conversion of almost 100% was attained in 2.3 seconds. The same reaction performed at a macro scale and at a strong stirring rate providing a calculated specific interfa- cial area of 40 cm2, gave a comparable conversion to that attained at a micro scale (calculated specific interfacial area of 80 cm2).

In the conventional way of performing reactions, the amount of waste generated is dealt with at the end of the reaction. On the contrary, microreactor technology enables the reduction of waste generated by increasing the atom efficiency of reactions and in so doing, the quantity of starting materials is reduced in turn minimizing the amount of waste generated. This aspect of microreactor technology will definitely prove to be quite impor- tant in the synthesis of these compounds more so that their production, however important they are, has adverse effects on the environment, mammals [20,21] and aquatic life. Even with a number of dye degradation techniques [22] currently being em- ployed in waste water treatment, a certain percentage of the dyestuffs is still found in water bodies. This therefore is motiva- tion for developing better methods or techniques or processes that can be used independently or in conjunction with the existing techniques. Microreactor technology is one such tech- nology that can be used in the manufacture of these dyes. If used in conjunction with existing azo dye degradation tech- niques the amount of waste generated can easily be managed.

In the synthesis of azo dyes and pigments, the cost of produc- tion and quality of the product cannot be over looked. Wille et al., in their investigative research involving the synthesis of two azo pigments (yellow and red pigments) in microreactors [24], demonstrated that scaling out in the microreactors provided better and more consistent quality of the pigments as compared to scale up in the batch vessels.

Similarly, yellow pigment 12 (15) was also synthesized by Pennemann et al. (Scheme 5) using a micro-mixer apparatus [25]; the group's comparison of the results with the batch syn- thesis of the said pigment 15 affirmed the notion that mixing is an essential unit operation in the synthesis of azo pigments.

Hisamoto et al., for example, used ‘phase transfer synthesis' in micro-chips for a diazo-coupling reaction [23]. The authors did not however employ a phase transfer catalyst, but rather the principle to increase the reaction selectivity in the diazo cou- pling of 5-methylresorcinol (10) to p-nitrobenzene diazonium tetrafloroborate (11) in a biphasic laminar flow reaction system. The bi-phasic reaction media consisted of compound 10 dis-

The pigment synthesized in a micro-mixer (25 µm channel width) at a flow rate of 30 mL/min had smaller pigment size distribution compared to the batch synthesized pigment. The fast mixing in the micro-mixer was noted to be responsible for

the improvement of glossiness (73%) and tinctorial strength (66%) of the yellow pigment thus yielding a good quality product.

syringes, two syringe pumps and an LTF-MS microreactor placed into a temperature control bath (as shown in Figure 6 in the experimental section). Following the experimental proce- dures outlined, a range of reaction conditions were evaluated, where the pH value is that of the stock solution (Table 1).

With all the various applications of azo compounds previously mentioned, it is therefore important to develop an optimized process for their synthesis. This was achieved with the use of the microreactor technology. Since the benefits of microreactor technology are well documented in literature [26-30], the ease of reaction parameter optimization in the synthesis of azo compounds in microreactors is highlighted.

In this study, the continuous flow synthesis of Sudan II azo dye (19, Scheme 6) constituting of the diazotization of 2,4- dimethylaniline (16) and its in situ azo coupling to 2-naphthol (18) within LTF-MS microreactors was investigated.

Although various groups have investigated similar reactions in microreactors, to the best of our knowledge, there is no detailed study combining the effect of pH, temperature and flow rate on the azo coupling reaction. In addition, industry always ques- tions why reactions are done in micro structured reactors rather than simple tubular reactors. As such, we extended this investi- gation to study the optimized conditions obtained within the LTF microreactors within PTFE tubing (i.d. 1.5 mm) in order to scale up the synthesis and to see if the size effect had any major implication on the reaction performance.

Results and Discussion Azo coupling reaction in the synthesis of 1-((2,4-dimethylphenyl)azo)naphthalen-2-ol in LTF-MS microreactors In an effort to exemplify the azo coupling of phenols as well as naphthol derivatives in alkaline reaction conditions, the synthe- sis of 1-((2,4-dimethylphenyl)azo)naphthalen-2-ol (19) also commonly known as Sudan II azo dye was used as a model reaction. The synthesis involved diazotization of 2,4-dimethyl- aniline (16) to form diazonium salt intermediate 17, which is coupled with 2-naphthol (18) under alkaline conditions (Scheme 6). The experimental set up comprised of two

A quadratic model was fitted onto the resultant calculated conversions of 2-naphthol as obtained from reversed-phase HPLC analysis output. STATISCA 12 – Statsoft program was thereafter used to validate the model fitted. The findings of this investigation are presented here in the form of simple profile plots.

Effect of reaction temperature, flow rate and pH on the reaction conversion The pH is of utmost importance in the azo coupling reaction, the second step in the synthesis of azo compounds. This reac- tion parameter is also dependent on the kind of coupling com- pound used [31]. For example, phenols are successfully coupled in alkaline conditions in which the phenolate ion is formed. These conditions provide the desired electron-releasing group thus facilitating the electrophilic substitution reaction to afford the azo compound. However, highly alkaline conditions are usually avoided as they lead to diazonium salt decomposition.

reaction conversion in the experimental domain employed for this investigation. In contrast, pH is shown to be of importance in this reaction considering that the p-value associated with its estimated coefficient (b) is less than 0.005. Furthermore, evi- dence of a quadratic relationship between pH and reaction conversion was also seen (pH^2, p < 0.005). Similarly, there was also a slight indication of a quadratic relationship between temperature and the response (Temperature^2, p = 0.076). There were no interactions observed between the reaction pa- rameters investigated.

In the plot (Figure 1), it is seen that at a flow rate of 0.03 mL/min, the pH has a non-linear relationship with the pre- dicted conversion of the coupler. In addition, the predicted conversion increases with an increase in reaction pH in this ex- perimental domain. The optimum pH that would provide the best conversion was predicted to be approximately 8.5 and the

In the regression summary of the statistical data analysis (Table 2) of the observed data, it is seen from the p-values (0.067 and 0.084) associated with the estimated coefficients (b) of flow rate and temperature respectively, that these two reac- tion parameters seem not to have a significant effect on the

most suitable reaction temperature was found to be 25 °C. Therefore, at a pH of about 8.5 and a reaction temperature of 25 °C, a reaction conversion of approximately 80% should be attained. As expected, at highly alkaline conditions (pH 9–11), the reaction conversion is predicted to gradually decrease. It is also seen that at 0 °C and 50 °C, slightly lower conversion is predicted (approximately 74%–75%). This could be attributed to decomposition of the reaction intermediate at higher tempera- tures (50 °C) and lowered rate of reaction at lower tempera- tures (0 °C).

acidic reaction conditions. The synthesis of 4-(2-(4-nitrophen- yl)diazenyl)-N-phenylbenzenamine was an interesting choice for demonstrating the synthesis of azo compounds involving couplers containing aminated aromatic systems.

It involves the diazotization of p-nitroaniline 2 to form 20 which is subsequently coupled to 21. Diphenylamine (21), the coupler used in this reaction is sparingly soluble in aqueous media thus rendering it quite difficult to use in this synthesis and as such, methanol was used as the azo coupling reaction media (Scheme 7). It is due to this that the pH of the diazonium compound solution was buffered to the preferred values for the reaction investigation as opposed to the conventional buffering of the coupler solution. Following the experimental procedures, a range of reaction conditions were evaluated (Table 3).

At a higher flow rate of 0.7 mL/min (Figure 2), a similar trend is observed with regard to the effect of pH on the reaction conversion. Similarly, a reaction temperature of 25 °C was pre- dicted to provide optimum conversion (75%). At this reaction temperature (25 °C), the predicted reaction conversion at this flow rate, is slightly lower (75%) compared to that predicted at a flow rate of 0.03 mL/min (80%). It was then concluded that the flow rate of the reactants in this experimental domain had no significant effect on the reaction response. For information, this flow rate range covers a residence time of 0.37 to 0.86 minutes.

A Logit model was then fitted onto the resultant calculated conversions of diphenylamine as obtained from reversed phase HPLC analysis output. STATISCA 12 – Statsoft program was thereafter used to validate the model fitted (see Supporting Information File 1). The result of this investigation is also presented here in form of simple profile plots.

on this response (pH^2, p < 0.005). Conversely, within this ex- perimental domain, there is evidence (Flow rate, p = 0.116) that shows that the flow rate of the reactants has a negligible effect on the reaction conversion. Looking at the p-value associated with the estimated coefficient (b) of the reaction temperature (temperature, p = 0.012), there is a slight indication of its signif- icance on the reaction conversion.

It is also demonstrated in Figure 3 that the effect of pH on the azo coupling reaction is quite conspicuous. It is seen that the reaction flourishes at a mildly acidic pH that being between 5.5 and 6.0 while temperature is predicted not to have a tremen- dous effect on the reaction conversion (Figure 3). A variation in reaction temperature between 0 °C and 50 °C provides a very slight improvement in conversion (from 82% to 95%).

The flow rate of the reactants (diazotized primary amine and coupler) was also investigated as mentioned earlier on. As is shown in Figure 4, based on the predicted conversion, there is no difference in carrying out the reaction at either 0.03 mL/min or 0.7 mL/min.

Moving on to the reaction temperature, unlike pH, it has a more or less linear relationship with predicted reaction conversion. There is a slight drop in the predicted conversion as the reac- tion temperature is increased from 0 °C to 50 °C. This is clearly shown in Figure 5 below.

An increase in the flow rate from 0.03–0.7 mL/min at a con- stant pH of 5.66 causes a 2% drop in predicted conversion whereas an increase in the reaction temperature from 0–50 °C at flow rates of 0.03, 0.33 and 0.7 mL/min at constant pH 5.66 is shown to lead to a less than 5% drop in the predicted conver- sion. It was thereafter concluded that in this experimental domain, the reaction temperature had no significant effect on the reaction conversion. For both reactions investigated thus far, it was found that the flow rate of the reactants in the chosen ex- perimental domain had little or no significant effect on the reac- tion conversion.

is more reactive than its unprotonated version is availed; it is also obvious that the protonation also renders the aromatic ring less nucleophilic.

In this reaction, like the one previously discussed, pH plays an important role and significantly affects the reaction conversion (p < 0.005) moreover (Table 4), it also has a non-linear effect

The effect of reaction parameters i.e. flow rate, temperature and pH on azo coupling reactions in the synthesis of azo com- pounds under acidic and alkaline reaction conditions in LTF- MS microreactors however, was successfully demonstrated. We therefore went ahead to fully make good use of the benefits that microreactor technology offers to organic syntheses such as this one by performing both reaction steps in continuous flow reac- tors.

attempt to perform both reaction steps involved in this synthe- sis in continuous flow reactors was thus made. This was achieved in LTF-MS reactors with the aid of statistical modeling where the continuous flow synthesis of Sudan II azo dye was optimized and used a model reaction.

Based on the statistical experimental central composite design used for the optimization of this synthesis, no descriptive trends showing the effect of the flow rates of reactants on the conver- sion of 2-naphthol could be obtained. At all varied reaction pa- rameters in the 20 experiments carried out, the response was relatively the same with no clear cut trends observed as is shown in Table 5. A quadratic regression model was then fitted

The continuous flow synthesis of 2-naphtholic, phenolic and similar azo compounds in LTF-MS microreactors At the reactant flow rates stated in the confirmatory experiment in Table 6, similar azo compounds were synthesized. To our delight, the reaction conditions were robust since comparable high conversions were also attained for the synthesis of similar azo compounds regardless of the substituent groups present on the coupler as well as diazotizable amine. This is shown in Table 7.

The continuous flow scaled-up synthesis of 2-naphtholic, phenolic and similar azo compounds in LTF-MS microreactors In the synthesis of azo compounds, there is usually formation of a precipitate, which renders this reaction problematic in microreactors due to blockages. The geometrical specifications of the microchannel are very important, so much that these dictate the concentration of the reagents used for the reaction, amount of solvent added to facilitate quick dissolution of partic- ulates as they are formed as well as the output of the reaction, i.e., conversion, yield and or even selectivity. The scaled-up synthesis of these compounds in PTFE tubing of 1.5 mm internal diameter is herein reported. The experimental set up of the scaled-up synthesis is shown in the experimental section (Figure 8). A comparison of the two microreactor systems, i.e., LTF-MS and the PTFE tubing microreactor systems is presented in Table 8. The reactions were conducted at appro- priate flow rates so as to maintain the same residence time used in the LTF-MS microreactors.

(amine + HCl) solution in this particular experimental domain has the most effect on the conversion (Partial correlation: 0.406, p = 0.094). The R-square value corresponding to the three vari- ables investigated was also found to be nil which indicated that there was no correlation between the variables investigated.

It was found that the synthesis of these compounds in a simple set up comprising of PTFE tubing (i.d. 1.5 mm) provided comparable conversions to those attained in the LTF-MS microreactors despite the geometrical specifications of the two reactor systems being quite different. It should also be noted that the PTFE tubing is much cheaper than the glass LTF-MS and at the internal diameter of the PTFE tubing used there were no occurrences of blockages witnessed due to precipitate forma- tion. This is particularly important since the amount of solvent used in the reactions can be kept at a bare minimum. Despite the fact that the geometrical specifications of the two reactor systems (LTF-MS microreactors and PTFE tubing) were quite different, the drop in conversion is not massive and can be circumvented by increasing the residence time in order to achieve even better conversions.

The reaction conditions at the center point (run with letter 'd' in the Table 5 above) of the central composite design used for the optimization were therefore used to generate a small library of compounds. Before embarking on this task, a confirmatory ex- periment to ascertain the reproducibility of the reaction output at these reaction conditions was performed and indeed a similar result was obtained (Table 6).

was found that at slightly alkaline conditions (pH 8.55) and at a temperature of 25 °C, excellent conversions were attained in the azo coupling reaction of the diazonium salt solution of 2,4- dimethylaniline to 2-naphthol whereas the azo coupling reac- tion of the diazonium salt solution of p-nitroaniline to diphenyl- amine was found to thrive at a pH of 5.71 and at a temperature of 25 °C. It should be noted that the data generated was ob- tained in a very short time. On the down side, for a couple of experiments, samples could not be collected due to the limita- tions of the microreactor used. There were blockages observed

due to precipitation of the product in the microreactor channels. This was particularly observed in the synthesis of 1-((2,4- dimethylphenyl)azo)naphthalen-2-ol at slow flow rates, temper- atures close to 25 °C and pH greater than 7. Nonetheless, the effect of the reaction parameters on the azo coupling reaction in the synthesis of azo compounds was shown. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first of its kind to expound the effect of pH, flow rate and temperature on the azo coupling reaction in the synthesis of azo compounds. A simple and fast continuous flow process was also thereafter developed for the

synthesis of naphtholic, phenolic and similar azo dyes. The robustness of the process was clearly demonstrated. In addition, an easy scale-up strategy was also established where it was found that the synthesis of these compounds in a simple contin- uous flow set up consisting of T-mixers and PTFE tubing (i.d.: 1.5 mm) provided relatively satisfactory reaction conversions moreover no occurrence of blockages was observed when this set up was in use. This finding is of importance especially when it comes to an increasing reaction throughput by the numbering up technique. Ideally, in evaluating the performance of two reactor systems in a chemical synthesis, it is important to keep most factors constant especially those pertaining to the geome- try of the reactor channel as this can affect the reaction output. Albeit comparable reaction conversions were attained from the two reactor systems investigated, it is worth determining the role that the difference in geometrical structure had to play in the data observed in this study.

Data analysis The total volume of samples collected (tvscollected) was calcu- lated by multiplying the total flow rate of the reactant solutions (tfrABC) by the total sample collection time (tcollection). The reaction time was calculated by dividing the total reaction space volume i.e. the total volume of the two LTF-MS plates, the PTFE tubing used to join the two mixers and also that leading to the final outlet: the point of sample collection by the total flow rate of reactant solutions (tfrABC). For purposes of data analysis, all flow rates were converted to liters/minute.
