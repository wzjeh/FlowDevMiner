Summary: Flow-chemistry process development for nitration of aromatic compounds using microreactors is described. The reaction involves mixed acid nitration of organic substrates like naphthalene. Key reactants include mixed acids (e.g., HNO3, H2SO4) and solvents (e.g., water). Products are intermediates such as 1-nitronaphthalene. The microreactor is a continuous flow type with smaller liquid holdup for enhanced mixing and heat transfer capacity. Critical conditions include precise control of residence time, temperature, pressure, and flow rate(s) depending on the specific reaction requirements. Outcomes may involve improved conversion/yield/selectivity compared to batch processes due to process enhancement through microreactors.

ABSTRACT: In this work, the continuous flow nitration of naphthalene to 1-nitronaphthalene was systematically studied from the microreactor to mesoscale flow reactor and the safety issues during the reaction process were investigated.

Su et al.15 performed nitration of o- nitrotoluene in the packed microreactor. Due to the out- standing dispersion and mass transfer capacity of the packed microreactor, the conversion of nitrotoluene reached up to 94% even when the reaction was less
