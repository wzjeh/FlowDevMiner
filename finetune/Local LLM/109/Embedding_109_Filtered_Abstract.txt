Summary: The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process development for the conversion of methylene blue dye using a microreactor with a packed-bed reactor ID. The key reactants are methylene blue and hydrogen peroxide, while the solvent is water. The catalyst used is an iron-based nanoparticle catalyst supported on carbon black. The products of the reaction are colorless compounds.

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of flow-chemistry processes for microreactor-based persulfate activation in water treatment applications. The process involves thermally or Fe(II)-catalyzed activation of potassium persulfate (KPS) to generate radicals that degrade Safranin O (SO), a carcinogenic dye, under controlled conditions. Key reactants include KPS and SO; the solvent is water. The reactor type is tubular microreactors with diameters of 1 mm and lengths between 2–6 m. Critical conditions include varying flow rates for KPS, Fe(II) solution (if used), and dye, as well as temperature (30–80 °C). The reactor is submerged in a water bath to maintain the desired temperature during experiments. Outcomes are assessed by monitoring conversion/yield/selectivity of SO degradation under various operating conditions.
