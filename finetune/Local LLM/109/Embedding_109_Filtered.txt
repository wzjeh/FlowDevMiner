3.1. Temperature Dynamics and Heat Transfer in a Micro-Tubular Reactor

The experimental setup is photo-captured and schematically illustrated in Figure 1. The experiments were conducted using a tubular microreactor with an internal diameter of 1 mm and a total length of 6 m, coiled into a spiral configuration and fully submerged in a thermostatic water bath (50 × 50 × 30 cm3) with precise temperature control (using JP Selecta Thermostat, JP Selecta, Abrera, Spain). The reactor was made from aluminum tubing with a wall thickness of 0.9 mm, ensuring efficient heat transfer.

Activation in Tubular Microreactors

Figure 2 illustrates the recorded reactor outlet temperature (Toutlet) as a function of the bath temperature (Tbath) for a micro-tubular reactor. The reactor inlet temperature (Tinlet) is maintained constant at 18 ◦C throughout the experiments. The bath temperature is systematically varied from 30 ◦C to 80 ◦C, and the corresponding outlet temperatures are measured. The experiments are conducted with a persulfate flow rate of 120 µL/s and a dye solution flow rate of 278 µL/s. The figure also includes the temperature difference (∆T = Toutlet −Tinlet ) as a function of Tbath, providing a clear depiction of the reactor's heat transfer performance under steady-state conditions.

observed mass transport limitations in the present work should be thoroughly addressed in future studies to improve the efficacy of the tubular system for efficient activation of persulfate and other oxidants in the presence of various catalysts. Additionally, while the present study provides experimental data demonstrating the performance of the micro plug-flow reactor for degrading Safranin O, future work will focus on modeling the system using material and thermal balances to determine concentration and temperature profiles along the reactor length, thereby enabling optimization of reactor dimensions for fixed inlet flow conditions.

cluding their compact design and large surface-to-volume ratios, which result in shorter diffusion and conduction distances, promoting laminar flow and improved mass transfer efficiency [23]. Additionally, microreactors can be constructed from transparent materials, allowing for real-time visualization of reaction processes and the integration of external light sources for photocatalytic AOPs [25]. These features enable efficient radical generation and pollutant degradation in a highly controlled setting, addressing some of the challenges faced by conventional reactor systems. Nevertheless, despite their potential, the use of microreactors in persulfate-based oxidation processes is still in its infancy, with limited research conducted on their applicability for water treatment purposes [25]. The present study aims to investigate the application of a tubular microreactor (2–6 m in length, 1 mm in diameter) submerged in a temperature-controlled water bath for ther- mally and Fe(II)-catalyzed persulfate activation, both separately and in combination (hybrid mode), to evaluate their efficiency in degrading Safranin O (SO). SO is a phenazine dye of the quinone-imine class, widely used in textiles and as a photosensitizer in electronand energy-transfer reactions [26]. It also serves as a sensitizer in visible light photopolymer- ization [27]. Given its known carcinogenic nature, any presence of this dye in wastewater poses significant risks to aquatic life and necessitates effective removal strategies [27]. The study systematically evaluates process performance under various operating conditions, including potassium persulfate (KPS) and dye flow rates, iron solution concentration (flow rate), and solution pH, across a temperature range of 30–80 ◦C. Additionally, the effective- ness of the thermal and thermo-catalytic persulfate activation processes was assessed in different water matrices, including seawater, river water, tap water, and mineral water, to determine their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. The benefits and limitations of these processes were highlighted, providing insights into the effective application of microreactors in advanced water treatment systems.

Figure 4 provides three sets of data, each corresponding to different dye flow rates [278 µL/s (3.96 × 10−3 µmol/s), 565 µL/s (8.05 × 10−3 µmol/s), and 1100 µL/s (15.68 × 10−3 µmol/s)], showing the effect of increasing dye flow on conversion efficiency at a fixed oxidant flow rate (120 µL/s). The removal efficiency of SO decreased with increas-
