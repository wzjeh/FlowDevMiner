for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol synthesis. Due to the limitation of heat transfer in fixed bed reactor, it is always challenging to avoid the hotspot and temperature runaway. The process intensification potential of microreactor has attracted attention in the field of energy technology. The specific features of microreactor mainly include: (1) enhanced heat and mass transfer, (2) narrow residenc

The monolithic catalyst and microreactor have been developed to enhance heat and mass transfer in the reaction system. The replacement and adhesion are significant in practicality in microreactor. Compared with present methods, the monolithic catalyst is more convenient in the replacement of spent catalysts, as other methods are often diﬃcult in changing the spent washcoating layer or catalyst par

summarized in Table 5. The high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) used in microreactor can significantly increase the selectivity of me- thanol [48,49]. From 5000 to 20,000 mL gcat −1 h−1, the conversion of CO2 decreases from 15.1% to 9.9% while the selectivity of methanol increases from 46.4% to 82.7%. According to thermodynamic analysis in Fig. S2, the methanol selectivity (46.4%) at 5000 mL g

It is speculated that the ad- vance heat and mass transfer properties of the microreactor result in the high methanol selectivity of Cn-Zn/Al foam catalyst.

The test of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol was carried out in a microreactor. The photographs of the reactor and experimental plat- form are shown in Fig. 2A and B. The reactor system was insulated by an insulation box with quartz visualization window (180 mm squared). The reactor was made by 316L stainless steel assembled plates. The exploded view of microreactor is illustrated in Fig. 2C. The cha

Summary: The paragraph discusses a parametric study on the effects of reaction conditions in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol system using microreactors. Reaction type is CO2 hydrogenation to methanol with reverse water gas shift (RWGS) as a reference. Key reactants are CO2 and H2, solvent is not mentioned, catalyst is also not specified. Products are methanol and other products from RWGS. Reactor details include microreactors without specific ID. Critical conditions are flow rate(s), residence time, temperature, and pressure which vary depending on the reaction type (CO2 hydrogenation or RWGS). Outcomes mentioned are conversion, yield, and selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol system.

microchannel [52]. The adhesion test of layer structure on aluminum foam was performed in an ultrasonic vibrating instrument (JP-031S, Skymen Cleaning Equipment Shenzhen Co., Ltd) [53]. The result of adhesion test is shown in Fig. 8 and weight loss of 1#, 2#, 3# sample are 0.67%, 0.65%, 0.84%, respectively. The average value, only 0.7%, indicates a good adhesion property of our monolithic catalyst

Summary: The paragraph discusses flow-chemistry process development for a copper-catalyzed methanol-to-olefins conversion reaction. Key reactants include methanol and oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol or propylene oxide). Copper serves as the catalyst, while solvents like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can be used to improve selectivity. The desired products are olefins such as ethylene and propylene. Reactor details include a microreactor with an ID of 500 µm and a length of 12 cm, operating at atmospheric pressure (1 bar) and temperatures between 80-140°C. Critical conditions involve flow rates for inlet/outlet gases (Fin/Fout), residence time, temperature, and pressure. Outcomes include conversion, yield, and selectivity of the reaction.

Moreover, three dimensional porous aluminum foam can keep an extremely low pressure drop under high gas flow rate. The thickness of layer structure obtained in present work is below 10 μm which is far less than 50 μm and it has been reported as a threshold layer thickness causing diﬀusion limitat
