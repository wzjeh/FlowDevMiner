Input
A typical case of diazotization of p-nitroaniline was studied systematically. Through the optimization of the crystallization process of p-nitroaniline, the slurries with an average crystal size of about 56 μm in length and 19 μm in width were obtained. The reaction mixture consisted of a solution containing sodium nitrite (0.1 M) as the oxidizing agent and hydrochloric acid (2M). In this study, we developed an efficient continuous-flow microreaction system to conduct diazotization reactions of weakly basic aromatic amines.
