into appropriate lengths (3.5, 25, 50, 100, and 300 cm). The micromixers and microtube reactors were connected with stainless steel fittings (GL Sciences, 1/16 OUW) to construct the flow microreactor systems. The flow microreactor system was dipped in the bath to control the temperature. The solutions were continuously introduced to the flow microreactor system using syringe pumps, Harvard PHD 2000, equipped with gastight syringes purchased from SGE or a plunger pump, shimadzu LC-20AT (Tokyo, Japan).

A flow microreactor system consisting of two T-shaped micromixers (M1 and M2), two microtube reactors (R1 and R2), and three tube precooling units (P1 (inner diameter φ = 1000 µm, length L = 100 cm), P2 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 50 cm), and P3 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 100 cm)) was used for the formation of lithium borate. A solution of bromobenzene (0.10 M in THF) (flow rate: 6.0 mL/min) and a solution of n-BuLi (0.60 M in hexane) (flow rate: 1.0 mL/min) were introduced to M1 (φ = 500 µm) at 0 ◦C by syringe pumps. The resulting solution was passed through R1 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 25 cm (tR1 = 1.7 s)) and was mixed with a solution of trimethoxyborane (0.12 M in THF) (flow rate: 5.0 mL/min) in M2 (φ = 500 µm) (0 ◦C). The resulting solution was passed through R2 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 50 cm (tR2 = 2.0 s)) (0 ◦C). The resulting solution was collected in a vessel. Then, a solution of p-iodobenzonitrile (0.033 M in MeOH (0.67 eq)) was added, and the resulting solution was passed through a flow reactor packed with a Pd catalyst supported by monolith A or monolith B at T ◦C by using a plunger pump. The reaction was carried out with various residence times (tR) by changing the flow rates at various temperatures (T). After a steady state was reached, the product solution was collected (10 min). The reaction mixture was analyzed by GC, and the results are summarized in Tables 5 and 6.

A solution of arylbromides (Ar1Br) (0.10 M in THF) (flow rate: 6.0 mL/min) and a solution of n-BuLi (0.60 M in hexane) (flow rate: 1.0 mL/min) were introduced to M1 (φ = 250 µm) by syringe pumps. The resulting solution was passed through R1 (1.7 s (φ = 1000 µm, L = 25 cm) or 0.059 s (φ = 500 µm, L = 3.5 cm)) and was mixed with a solution of trimethoxyborane (0.12 M in THF) (flow rate: 5.0 mL/min) in M2 (φ = 250 µm). The resulting solution was passed through R2 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 50 cm (tR2 = 2.0 s)). The resulting solution was collected in a vessel. Then, a solution of arylhalides (Ar2X) (0.033 M in MeOH (0.67 eq)) was added, and the mixing solution was passed through a single monolith B reactor (0.10 mL/min (19.2 min), 120 ◦C) or three monolith B reactors connected in series (0.10 mL/min (57.6 min), 120 ◦C). After a steady state was reached, the product solution was collected (10 min). The yield of the product was determined by GC analysis or isolation. The results are summarized in Table 2.

A solution of 2-(1-Adamantyl)-4-bromoanisole (0.10 M in THF) (flow rate: 6.0 mL/min) and a solution of n-BuLi (0.60 M in hexane) (flow rate: 1.0 mL/min) were introduced to M1 (φ = 500 µm) at 0 ◦C by syringe pumps. The resulting solution was passed through R1 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 50 cm (tR1 = 3.4 s)) and was mixed with a solution of trimethoxyborane (0.12 M in THF) (flow rate: 5.0 mL/min) in M2 (φ = 500 µm). The resulting solution was passed through R2 (φ = 1000 µm, L = 50 cm (tR2 = 2.0 s)). The resulting solution was collected in a vessel. Then, a solution of methyl 6-iodo-2-naphthoate (0.033 M in THF/MeOH = 1.5:1) was added, and the mixing solution was passed through a monolithic reactor at 120 ◦C by a plunger pump. The reaction was carried out using a single monolith A reactor (flow rate: 0.2 mL/min) (residence time: 9.4 min) or five monolith B reactors (flow rate: 1.0 mL/min) (residence time: 9.5 min). After a steady state was reached, the product solution was collected in 21 h (a single monolith A reactor) or 4 h (five monolith B reactors). After the evaporation of the solvents, the crude product was thoroughly washed with MeOH (2 × 150 mL) to give methyl 6-(3-(1-adamantyl)-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-naphthoate (1.55 g (one single monolith A reactor), 1.49 g (five monolith B reactors)). Methyl 6-(3-(1-adamantyl)-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-naphthoate (0.517 g) and mL of 1,2-propanediol were placed in a flask, and the mixture was heated to 190 ◦C. The resulting transparent solution was supplemented with 0.534 g of sodium hydroxide in two portions and mixed for 20 min. The mixture was acidified until pH 1 with 6 N HCl. The resulting suspension was mixed for 30 min and washed with hot water (2 × 50 mL). After drying for 12 h at 120 ◦C, the yield was 0.458 g (89%).

In general, the productivity can be increased by increasing the flow rate in a single flow reactor (Figure 8a). However, the increase in the flow rate often causes a decrease in the conversion because the residence time in the reactor becomes shorter. Therefore, the numbering-up method with a parallel connection of the flow reactors serves as a common approach to improve the productivity [126–130] (Figure 8b). However, the method often suffers from a poor uniformity in fluid distribution [131,132]. Therefore, various types of flow distributors such as manifold[133,134], bifurcation-, and split-and-recombine-type flow distributors have been developed to improve the uniformity of the fluid distribution.
