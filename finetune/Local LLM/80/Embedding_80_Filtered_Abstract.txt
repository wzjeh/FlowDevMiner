into appropriate lengths (3.5, 25, 50, 100, and 300 cm). The micromixers and microtube reactors were connected with stainless steel fittings (GL Sciences, 1/16 OUW) to construct the flow microreactor systems. The flow microreactor system was dipped in the bath to control the temperature. The solutions were continuously introduced to the flow microreactor system using syringe pumps, Harvard PHD 200

Summary: The paragraph discusses flow-chemistry process development for increasing productivity in a single flow reactor by optimizing the flow rate while maintaining conversion. Parallel connection of flow reactors is used as a common approach (Figure 8b). However, poor fluid distribution uniformity leads to variations in productivity. Various flow distributors have been developed to address this issue: manifold-, bifurcation-, and split-and-recombine-type flow distributors. The summary does not mention any specific reaction type, key reactants/solvent/catalyst, products, reactor details (type/ID), critical conditions (flow rate(s), residence time, temperature, pressure), or outcomes (conversion/yield/selectivity).
