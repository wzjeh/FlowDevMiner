- Temperature is in °C; residence_time and flow_rate are normalized to min and mL/min respectively.

The Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction was performed using a Pd catalyst supported by a polymer monolith. The microreactor system consisted of two micromixers (M1 and M2) followed by two microtube reactors (R1 and R2). Lithiation, borylation, and the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions were carried out in sequence.

The reaction conditions for each step are as follows:

Lithiation: T=20 °C; residence time 10 min
Borylation: T=50 °C; flow rate of borane (reactant A) = 0.2 mL/min, total flow rate = 1 mL/min

Suzuki-Miyaura coupling:
T=80 °C;
flow rates for reactants A and B are not specified.
The optimal yield is achieved at a residence time of 10 min.

For the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction, the conversion was found to be 90% with an optimal selectivity of 95%.
