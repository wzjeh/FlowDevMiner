been reported.5 The very first reactors were developed by the group of Fréchet and Svec6 and were based on polymers. These reactors have then been further developed by the group of Kunz and Kirschning7 to obtain hybrid glass/polymer reactors that have been used for a large variety of organic transformations. To overcome swelling problems of polymer monoliths a new generation of unconventional molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) has been introduced8,9.
The first reactor was developed by the group of Fréchet and Svec6 in 1992. The very first reactors were based on polymers. These reactors have then been further developed by the group of Kunz and Kirschning7 to obtain hybrid glass/polymer reactors that have been used for a large variety of organic transformations.
The reactor was operated at T=80 °C in a 0.5 mm coil; yield 82%.
Flow rate 0.1 mL/min, T=80 °C in a 0.5 mm coil; yield 85% and residence time of 10 min.

paragraph = """
The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process development for hydrogenation reactions using Pd-MonoSil catalyst. Key reactants are cyclooctadiene or 3-hexyn-1-ol in methanol solvent. Hydrogen gas is used as the reducing agent, and the products are not mentioned. The reactor type is a cladded Pd-MonoSil catalyst with a constant flow rate of ca. 0.12 mL min−1 for cyclooctadiene and ca. 0.2 mL min−1 for 3-hexyn-1-ol, together with a constant H2 flow rate of ca. 0.5 mL min−1 at room temperature. The pressure drops generated by the monolithic reactors are between 1 and 2 bars. Steady state conditions (ca. 1–3 h) are taken as the reaction start time. Conversion is analyzed by GC, while Pd leaching analysis is performed using ICP-OES with a Varian 720ES instrument at a sensitivity of 500 ppb.
