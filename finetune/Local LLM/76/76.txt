Well-dispersed Pd nanoparticles have been synthesized inside the mesoporosity of a silica monolith fea-

turing hierarchical porosity of homogeneous interconnected macropores (4 microns) and mesopores

(11 nm). These monoliths have been implemented as microreactors for selective hydrogenation reactions. Conversion and selectivity can be tuned by adjusting the flow rates of hydrogen and substrates. In the

selective hydrogenation of cyclooctadiene, a conversion of 95% and a selectivity of 90% in the monohy-

drogenated product, constant over a period of 70 h, have been reached. These figures correspond to a productivity of 4.2 mmol s−1 g−1 MonoSil (or 0.32 mol s−1 g−1 Pd). In the stereoselective hydrogenation of 3-

These reactors have then been further developed by the group of Kunz and Kirschning7 to obtain hybrid glass/polymer reactors that have been used for a large variety of organic transform- ations. To overcome swelling problems of polymer monoliths a new generation of unconventional monolithic inorganic (silica) microreactors for catalysis has appeared,8 which are formed by a combination of spinodal decomposition and a sol–gel process featuring an interconnected and homogeneous system of macropores (2–4 microns) and comprising within their skeleton homogeneously distributed mesopores adjusta- ble in size (3–40 nm).9 This novel family of structured micro- reactors features high chemical and physical stability with a high condensation state of silica (76% of Q4 and 24% of Q3)9c

1. Introduction

Chemistry in flow is a promising option for the implemen- tation of catalytic reactions enabling process intensification and simplified workups. Continuous flow chemistry allows in addition safer process operation through better control of re- action parameters such as temperature, contact time, flow rate, minimization of solvent use, etc.1 Better control of contact time leads in turn to improved product selectivity and yield in comparison to batch reactors and represents a valuable tool for process intensification.1 Recently, eﬀorts have been made for the design of eﬃcient microreactors comprising either microstructured multichannel reactors2 or macroporous monoliths.3 Macroporous monoliths present the advantages of an interconnected and isotropic network of macropores allow- ing high surface-to-volume ratios and eﬃcient mixing of fluids.4

alumina membrane reactor demonstrated very promising activity for the selective hydrogenation of 1,5-cycloocta- diene.22a The alumina membrane reactor proved to be more productive than batch and packed-bed reactors.22a However it suﬀered from several drawbacks, among them a low surface area (8 m2 g−1), a poor dispersion of the Pd NPs at the surface, the formation of oligomers during the reaction due to residual acidity of the support which imposed intermediate reactivation steps aﬀecting long term productivity, and the need for a rela- tively complex and large set-up to operate such a reactor. Herein we present an alternative to membrane reactors for selective hydrogenation reactions using Pd-particles supported on a pore-flow-through monolith featuring a bimodal porosity and a high surface area (600 m2 g−1) easy to operate under soft conditions (25 °C, 2–3 bars H2) under continuous flow. This unconventional Pd-silica monolith microreactor was used for the selective hydrogenation of 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 3-hexyn-1-ol.

mesoporous silica because the interconnected network of macropores allows for rapid diﬀusion resulting in improved reaction kinetics. They have also shown that too small meso- pores (<10 nm) restrict mass diﬀusion. The productivity in fine chemicals transformations was increased by using higher flow rates until the point where contact times were not enough to ensure high conversion.10,11 Previously we have shown that these new kinds of pore-flow-through silica monolith micro- reactors induced high productivity and high stability for base and acid catalyzed reactions of fine chemicals in the liquid phase under continuous flow.3b,8,10 The superiority of this new kind of monolith, used as a single piece microreactor, was demonstrated by the higher conversions and productivities achieved compared to packed-bed or batch reactors filled with crushed monolith.8,10 This result is most probably due to the more uniform contact time arising for the homogeneity of the macroporous network in the single piece monolith in compa- rison to the dual macroporosity (interand intra-particle) encountered in a packed-bed system. In the present study, we analyze the eﬀectiveness of these promising pore-flow-through silica monolith microreactors in a triphasic liquid/gas/solid system for selective hydrogenation reactions under conditions allowing a fine control of gas and liquid contact times on Pd nanoparticles (NPs) catalytic sites immobilized onto the silica network. Diﬀerent groups have reported on the catalytic behavior of Pd NPs supported on polymeric matrixes, dendrimers, zeolites and dispersed silica in selective hydrogenation.15 Selective hydrogenation of hydrocarbons with multiple CvC and/or CuC and/or CvO bonds to achieve selective hydrogenation products (e.g. monoalkenes) is a highly desired and challen- ging process in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and petro- chemical industry sectors.16 Under comparable conditions, hydrogenation rates roughly followed the order CuC > CvC > CvO. This behavior can be justified in terms of greater aﬃnity of Pd for CvC than for CvO bonds in aliphatic compounds.17

2. Experimental section

2.1 Synthesis of the macro-/mesoporous silica monolith

The synthesis of the macro-/mesoporous silica monolith has been adapted from the original synthesis developed by Nakanishi.9a In a flask 46.3 g distilled H2O and 4.6 g HNO3 (68%, Aldrich) were mixed for 15 min at 0 °C and 4.79 g of PEO (20 kDa, Aldrich 99%) were added and stirred for 1 h. Then 37.7 g TEOS (Aldrich 99%) were added and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The resulting solution was poured into PVC tubes of 10 cm length and 8 mm internal diameter and kept at 40 °C for 3 days. The monoliths were then washed in water and treated in an ammonia solution (0.1 M) at 40 °C for 20 h. The monoliths were then dried at 40 °C for 24 h and calcined at 550 °C for 8 h. These silica monoliths (10 cm length and 6 mm diameter, 0.08 g cm−1) were cut into pieces of desired size (2 cm) and are hereafter named as parent monoliths or MonoSils.

Similar behavior (CvC > CvO) has been noticed using Ni- titania crushed monolith in packed-bed reactors.14 Particu- larly, the stereoand chemo-selective hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes in the presence of other functional groups is of fundamental importance in the synthesis of food additives, flavors and fragrances.18 For instance, there is growing interest in new hydrogenation processes under soft conditions that reduce the amount of double bonds in vegetable oils to product oils with higher consistency, stability and oxidation resistance, but also to avoid trans fatty acid esters as trans isomers have negative eﬀects on health.19 The formation of cis- alkenes through stereo-selective addition of H2 on alkynes is also an important step in industrial processes as in fragrance production (e.g. cis-3-hexen-1-ol leaf alcohol with a production of 400 tons per year).20 Selective hydrogenation reactions are also crucial in polymerization processes to achieve the com- plete elimination of alkynes and dienes from alkene feed- stocks.21 Flow processes could be a solution to finely tune the selectivity of these reactions by limiting the hydrogenation to one double bond. In that respect Pd NPs deposited on an

2.2 Synthesis of Pd-nanoparticles in the silica monolith (Pd-MonoSil)

A solution containing Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 (0.141 mmol, 0.042 g, Aldrich 98%) in water (10 mL) was prepared. The pH of the Pd complex solution was adjusted to 8, 9 or 10 using a 0.1 M ammonia solution. The 2 cm length silica monoliths were immerged into these solutions. The amount of Pd in the initial solution corresponded to 1.5 Pd wt% with respect to silica. Monoliths were impregnated for 24 h at room tempera- ture under gentle agitation at 100 rpm. The monoliths were then subsequently washed with distillated water (1 L), dried at 40 °C for 72 h and calcined at 550 °C for 8 h to form Pd oxide nanoparticles inside the silica monoliths. The reduction of PdO NPs was then performed with diluted hydrogen (3 vol% H2 in He) at 280 °C for 2 h. The resulting monoliths are here- after named Pd-MonoSils. For use as flow microreactors, the monoliths ended with two glass tubes and were cladded with a

was collected for GC analysis and the excess amount of the hydrogen gas released at atmospheric pressure. Commercially available H2 (99.995%) was used as received. In a typical experiment, the Pd-MonoSil catalyst (0.154 g, 1.3 Pd wt%) was first washed under flow with deaerated methanol at a flow rate of 0.15 mL min−1 at room temperature. No leaching of Pd was observed. A deaerated solution of the substrate (cyclooctadiene or 3-hexyn-1-ol) in methanol (0.1 and 0.2 M, respectively) was then allowed to flow through the cladded Pd-MonoSil catalyst (0.154 g, 1.3 Pd wt%) at a constant flow rate of ca. 0.12 mL min−1, together with a constant H2 flow rate of ca. 0.5 mL min−1 at room temperature, while the hydrogen gas was released at atmospheric pressure at the outlet of the reactor. For cyclooctadiene the substrate solution flow rate was varied between 0.05 and 0.25 mL min−1 and the H2 flow rate between 0.3 and 0.55 mL min−1. This resulted in a H2 pressure at the reactor inlet between 2.2 and 2.4 bars corresponding to a molar ratio 2.2 < H2/cyclooctadiene < 4.5. For 3-hexyn-1-ol the substrate solution flow rate was varied between 0.05 and 0.25 mL min−1 and the H2 flow rate between 0.2 and 1.3 mL min−1. This resulted in a H2 pressure at the reactor inlet between 2.4 and 3.1 bar corresponding to a molar ratio 0.6 < H2/hexynol < 2.5. Therefore, the pressure drops gen- erated by monolithic reactors were between 1 and 2 bars. The attainment of the steady state conditions (ca. 1–3 h) was taken as the reaction start time. The product solution was period- ically analyzed for conversion by GC, while 7.2 mL h−1 aliquots were continuously sampled for subsequent Pd leaching analysis. The content of palladium leached in the catalysis solutions was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emis- sion Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) with a Varian 720ES instrument at a sensitivity of 500 ppb. Each sample (7.2 mL) was treated in a microwave-heated digestion bomb (Milestone, MLS-200) with concentrated HNO3 (1.5 mL), 98% H2SO4 (2 mL), 37% HCl (0.5 mL) and a pellet of a digestion aid reagent (0.5 g, 0.1% Se in K2SO4). The solutions were analyzed directly after 1 : 5 dilution in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid.

2.3. Materials characterization

The physico-chemical properties of the monoliths were charac- terized by nitrogen sorption at 77 K, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Supernatants of Pd complex solutions after impreg- nation were analyzed with UV/Vis spectroscopy. The adsorption–desorption isotherms of nitrogen at 77 K were determined using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument after outgassing the samples (30 mg) at 250 °C under high vacuum (0.5 Pa) for 8 h with pressures between 0.001 < p/p0 < 0.9959 with an equilibrium interval of 5 s and 36 points in adsorption and 30 points in desorption. The mesopore volume was taken at the end of the filling of the mesopores. Surface area was determined by the BET (Brunauer Emmett Teller) equation considering the Rouquerol law to determine the highest relative pressure to use in the BET method.23 The mesopore diameter was determined using the desorption branch of the nitrogen isotherm and the Broekhoﬀand De Boer method as it has been demonstrated to be one of the more accurate methods for mesoporous silica materials.24 The morphology of the monoliths was examined using a Hitachi S-4500 I SEM. The chemical analysis of the monolith was per- formed by EDX on diﬀerent parts of cut pieces of the Pd- MonoSils using a FEI instrument Quanta 200F (15 kV) in retro- diﬀusion. TEM images have been obtained with a JEOL 1200 EX II at 100 kV after grinding the monoliths, dispersing the powder in ethanol and deposition of the carbon grid. UV/Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8452 A diode array spectrophotometer.

2.4 Selective hydrogenation of 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 3-hexyn-1-ol

For the implementation of the flow experiments a system was designed to allow for simultaneous flow of a substrate solution and hydrogen gas (up to 40 bars pressure) through a reactor tube containing the Pd-MonoSil catalysts. The reactor was completely inert, as all wet parts were made of PEEK (poly- ether ether ketone), PFA (perfluoroalkoxy) or PTFE (polytetra- fluoroethylene). The flow of the substrate solution was regulated by an Alltech® model 426 HPLC pump in PEEK. A constant flow of hydrogen gas was adjusted by a flow controller BRONKHORST HI-TEC model F200CV-002-RGD-11-V-MFC. The hydrogen pressure in the reactor was monitored by a BRONKHORST HI-TEC P502C-AGD-11-V-6K0R-EPC meter. The concurrent flows of gas and liquid were driven through a T-shaped PEEK mixer to ensure eﬃcient gas dispersion. The mixed hydrogen–substrate solution stream was introduced into the reactor through a 6-port Rheodyne mod. 9060 switching valve in PEEK. The Pd-MonoSils cladded into a heat-shrinkable PTFE tube together with two glass tubes (4 mm inner diameter) at each end were connected in a top-down arrangement to the system by PFA Swagelok fittings and Chemraz® O-rings (ESI Scheme S1‡). At the outlet of the reactor, the product solution

3. Results and discussion

3.1 Characterization of Pd-MonoSil

The functionalization of the parent silica monoliths with Pd nanoparticles was carried out by impregnation of the monoliths with an aqueous solution of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2. The initial Pd amount corresponds to 1.5 wt% with respect to silica. The increase of the pH of the impregnation solution leads to an increase of the amount of Pd incorporated within the silica monolith due to an increase of the negative charge of the surface of the silica support. Pd(NH3)4 2+ ions are introduced on the silica surface by ion-exchange with the protons on the silica surface, which compensate the negative charge of the silica. Impregnations at pH 8 (Pd-MonoSil-1), pH 9 (Pd-MonoSil-2) and pH 10 (Pd-MonoSil-3) have been carried out. The amount of impregnated Pd complex was monitored by comparing

adsorption maxima at λ = 300 nm (adsorption band of Pd (NH3)4(NO3)2) of the initial solution and the resulting super- natant solution after the impregnation with the monolith. The percentage of Pd incorporated within the silica mono- liths increases linearly from 4 to 89% with the increase of pH from 8 to 10 and corresponds therefore to a loading of 0.06, 0.66 and 1.33 Pd wt% with respect to silica for Pd-MonoSil-1, -2 and -3, respectively (Fig. 1). Pd-MonoSil-3 with a Pd content of 1.33 Pd wt% (UV/Vis) was subsequently calcined at 550 °C and the Pd complexes in electrostatic interaction with the silica surface are changed by Pd migration into nanoparticles of PdO at the surface of the silica. Then the PdO NPs are trans- formed into metallic Pd0 NPs by reduction under H2 at 280 °C. The reduction process changes the color of the monolith from yellow (PdO NPs) to brown (Pd0 NPs in the monolith) (Fig. 2). EDX analysis carried out on a cross section of the entire mono- lith confirms this observation with evenly distributed Pd atoms with a calculated amount of 1.28 wt%, in accordance with previous UV/Vis analysis of the supernatant solutions during impregnation. The nitrogen sorption isotherm at 77 K of Pd-MonoSil-3 (after reduction) shows that the silica mesopores network of the monolith was kept intact throughout the synthesis of Pd NPs in the monolith (Fig. 3). In comparison to the parent silica mono- lith the surface area decreases slightly from 523 to 490 m2 g−1, the mesoporous volume from 1.19 to 1.18 mL g−1 and the meso- pore diameter increases slightly from 11 to 12 nm. From TEM images it can be clearly seen that Pd-MonSil-3 contains well-dispersed Pd NPs featuring particle sizes with

average diameters of 6–7 nm within the silica monolith (Fig. 4). No particles larger than 11 nm have been detected, which indicates that the Pd NPs were formed within the meso- pores (11–12 nm) of the silica monolith. The SEM image of the Pd-MonoSil-3 shows that the homogeneous and isotropic inter- connected network of macropores (ca. 4 microns) was kept intact during the formation of Pd NPs within the monolith (Fig. 4).

3.2. Selective hydrogenation under continuous flow with Pd-MonoSil

Before performing catalytic reactions, Pd-MonoSil-3 was washed under a flow of 0.15 mL min−1 of methanol. No Pd leaching was evidenced by ICP-OES analysis of the solutions. Pd-MonoSil-3 was used as a catalyst in the hydrogenation under continuous flow at room temperature and low H2 pressure (2–3 bars) of 1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD) and 3-hexyn- 1-ol using methanol as a solvent (Scheme 1). The eﬃciency of Pd-MonoSil-3 (1.3 Pd wt%) was first tested for the selective hydrogenation of COD in cyclooctene (COE). As shown in Fig. 5, under the test conditions a constant con- version of 95% and a constant selectivity in COE of 90% were obtained after ca. 2 hours and a half under flow. The conver- sion and the selectivity are controlled by tuning H2 and sub- strate flow rates (Fig. 6). Increasing H2 flow rate increases the

content was below the detection limit of the ICP-OES instru- ment, i.e. 0.006 ppm, thus indicating that the Pd loss is negli- gible even after 70 h time-on-stream. In that time interval only a slight decrease in conversion from 95 to 90% was noticed. Similar conversion and selectivity levels (95–100 and 92–94%, respectively) were obtained using a Pd@alumina membrane reactor for 1,5-cyclooctadiene selec- tive hydrogenation in flow at 50 °C and 10 bars of hydrogen pressure.23 The pore-flow-through monolithic reactor loaded with Pd NPs allows one to reach the same performance under softer conditions (25 °C, 2.6 bars) and, above all, demonstrates unique stability with time on stream definitely enabling con- tinuous process operation. The second reaction investigated using Pd-MonoSil is the stereo-selective hydrogenation of 3-hexyn-1-ol, a reaction of prime importance carried out very eﬃciently in industry in batch mode using the Lindlar catalyst (Pd NPs deposited on calcium carbonate) (89% selectivity in alkene). A main short- coming in this reaction is the use of toxic additives as Pb,23

which can further be found in food products. There is there- fore a need for greener catalysts for this reaction. Diﬀerent additives have been tested on Pd supported catalysts such as quinoline, carbon monoxide, organic bases, sulfides, metal ions such as copper, which are necessary to reach high stereo- selectivity in this reaction, namely 99% cis-selectivity and 97% yield in 3-hexen-1-ol in batch mode.21a

In order to determine whether this reaction could be implemented in continuous mode, we have evaluated the per- formance of the Pd-MonoSil (1.3 wt% Pd) microreactor in the selective hydrogenation of 3-hexenyl-1-ol at room temperature with a hydrogen flow rate of 0.7 mL min−1 and a substrate flow rate of 0.15 mL min−1. Under these conditions a constant con- version level equal to ca. 85% was reached after 3 h under flow while the selectivity into 3-hexen-1-ol (cis + trans) increased steadily from 70 till 80% during the 7 h of the test (Fig. 7). The substrate conversion and the selectivity in alkene products can be tuned by adjusting the flow rates of the substrate solution and of H2 gas. Complete conversion of 3-hexyn-1-ol was achieved by increasing H2 flow rate, but the selectivity in alkenes decreased to 40%. As expected increasing H2 flow rate increases the conversion by adding more H2 in contact with the substrate and Pd NPs but decreases the selectivity by forming the 3-hexanol dihydrogenated product. The cis-

conversion and changes marginally the selectivity, with a slight decrease noticed from 94 to 89%. Increasing substrate flow rate (at the same H2 to substrate ratio of 4) decreases slightly the conversion from 92 to 80% due to a decrease in contact time of cyclooctadiene with the catalyst, whilst the selectivity increases from 82 to 94%. The best compromise between conversion and selectivity was reached with a flow rate of substrate of 0.12 mL min−1 and a H2 flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1 giving 95% conversion and 90% selectivity. The pro- ductivity of the reaction was 4.2 mmol s−1 g−1 MonoSil or 0.32 mol s−1 g−1 Pd. The stability of the catalyst proved remark- able as conversion and selectivity were maintained nearly con- stant over a period of 70 h. During the whole reaction Pd

microreactors for the continuous selective hydrogenation at room temperature of 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 3-hexyn-1-ol model substrates. In both reactions, the catalytic microreactor demonstrates remarkable stability of the activity with time on stream. The substrate conversion level as well as the selectivity into the target product can be readily controlled by indepen- dently adjusting the hydrogen and substrate flow rates. In the selective hydrogenation of 1,5-cyclooctadiene, a conversion of 95% and a selectivity of 90% in monohydrogenated product, constant over a period of 70 h, have been reached. These figures correspond to a productivity of 4.2 mmol s−1 g−1 MonoSil (or 0.32 mol s−1 g−1 Pd) and compare well with benchmark membrane based catalysts. In the stereoselective hydrogen- ation of 3-hexyn-1-ol a constant conversion of 85% and a selec- tivity of 80% into the cis isomer have been obtained over a period of 7 h, corresponding to a 10 times higher productivity in comparison to batch using the Lindlar catalyst. The versati- lity and flexibility of the monolithic microreactor in triphasic systems have been demonstrated and open new perspectives for the implementation of fine chemicals synthesis in continu- ous flow mode.

Fig. 8 Hydrogenation of 3-hexyn-1-ol (0.2 M in methanol) over Pd-MonoSil-3 at room temperature under continuous flow with (a) substrate flow rate 0.15 mL min−1 and variable H2 flow rate (variable H2/substrate); (b) constant H2/substrate = 2.7 molar ratio and variable substrate and H2 flow rates; (c) alkene selectivity and cis-selectivity (cis-3-hexen-1-ol) as a function of conversion of 3-hexyn-1-ol hydrogenation (same experimental conditions as in (a)).

selectivity decreases from 88 to 64% upon increasing the hydrogen flow rate from 0.2 to 1.3 mL min−1 (Fig. 8c). Higher selectivity in alkene products was achieved, up to 80%, by increasing substrate flow rate at a constant H2/substrate molar ratio with a minimal decrease of the conversion (72%) (Fig. 8). An increase in the solution flow rate (i.e. a decrease of the resi- dence time from 420 to 140 s while keeping a constant H2/sub- strate molar ratio) invariably led to an increase in partial hydrogenation. For a constant conversion, the cis-selectivity remains constant over time. The best conversion and selectiv- ity in cis-3-hexen-1-ol was achieved at a H2 flow rate of 0.7 mL min−1 and a substrate flow rate of 0.15 mL min−1 and gives a productivity of 9.6 mmol s−1 g−1 MonoSil or 0.75 mol s−1 g−1 Pd. Although the performances in terms of product selectivity stand below those of the Lindlar catalyst these preliminary results highlight the high potential and the flexibility of the Pd-MonoSil operated in continuous flow for a rather complex selective hydrogenation reaction. Pd-MonoSil can be used under flow conditions, with enormous benefits from an indus- trial point of view in terms of long-term productivity and space-to-time yield (STY): e.g. for 3-hexyn-1-ol hydrogenation, the STY (calculated from ref. 20e) of the Lindlar catalyst is 26 g l−1 h−1 vs. 270 g l−1 h−1 for Pd-MonoSil. Furthermore, the increase of selectivity with time on stream with Pd-MonoSil suggests some negative influence of surface sites (silanol groups), which can be amended by passivation treatments. The eﬀect of green additives can be readily investigated. Work in these directions is in progress.
