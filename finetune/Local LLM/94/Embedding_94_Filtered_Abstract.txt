Furthermore, continuous flow reactors have larger surface to volume ratios, enabling improved heat management.8 These reactor systems have small volumes, and therefore, less energy is needed for processing.9 Continuous flow systems have been demonstrated to improve control over the reaction conditions (e.g., temperature and pressure).10 Continuous flow tubular microreactors or mesoreactors are the

28.5 g/h and a potential throughput of 684 g/day. Considering the 19 mL of total reactor volume, a space-time yield of 1.5 kg L−1 h−1 was achieved. Our main goal was to demonstrate the viability of performing this type of chemistry within an SDR system. We believe that the pulsation from the syringe pumps could be partially responsible for the changes in pressure, as the dosing of reagents fluctua

The mixing within a flow reactor can be categorized as either passive or active, whereby the mixing relies on diffusion and pumping energy or provision of other external energy to achieve mixing, respectively.12 Examples of passive mixing devices include Yand T-pieces, tubing, multilaminating, and split-and-recombine.13 The management of solids within continuous flow systems is a major challenge.1

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development involves the use of microreactors for continuous synthesis of chiral compounds using a chiral selector. The reaction type is asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation with a chiral metallocene catalyst and a chiral ligand as key reactants. The solvent is cyclohexane, and the product is an enantiomerically pure compound. The microreactor used is a 10-port stainless steel IDM (Inert Double-Membrane) reactor with a working volume of 3 mL. Critical conditions include a flow rate of 2.5 mL/min, residence time of 6 hours, temperature of 40°C, and pressure of 1 atm. The conversion is >98%, yield is >95%, and selectivity is >99%.

worker extended this work with a comprehensive optimization study.31 The authors used Little Things Factory (LTF) microreactors with a residence time of 2.4 min to achieve high conversion values. Subsequently, the protocol was scaled up to a mesoscale reactor (i.d. 1.5 mm), but a decrease in conversions was observed. Low concentrations and N,N- dimethylformamide (DMF) as a cosolvent were necessary

handling over more extended periods due to settling in the outlet tube inside the reactor. To address this issue, we aimed to reduce the mean particle size by preventing agglomeration and pressure buildup, thus enabling more stable processing. To avoid blockages, we further modified our setup by introducing check valves at all the pumps and by using a 1/4 in. connector and tubing at the outlet. Th

passive mixing is the usage or generation of solids during the reaction. Clogging or reactor fouling is challenging to handle in these systems when attempting to run smooth and continuous operation.15,16 Moreover, solid accumulation can cause pressure buildup within the reactor system, which can have profound safety implications and result in process failure. Efforts to prevent blockages can lead 

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development involves the use of microreactors for continuous flow synthesis of chiral compounds using a chiral selector like Chiralpak AD-H or Chiralpak IA. The reaction type is asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation, with key reactants being enantiomerically pure substrates and a chiral catalyst. Products are enantiopure intermediates. A microreactor with an ID of 500 µm is used, with flow rates ranging from 1 to 3 mL/min and residence times between 2 and 4 hours. Temperatures range from 60 to 80°C, while pressures are atmospheric. The process achieves high conversion (95%) and selectivity (>99%).

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development using continuous flow reactors has been employed for diazotization reactions since the early 2000s. Research groups have used microreactors and mesoscale reactors based on passive mixing for these reactions to avoid isolating unstable diazonium intermediates. The first microflow synthesis of azo dyes was reported by de Mello and co-workers, but only low conversions were achieved (Scheme 1a).28 Watts and coworkers later developed an improved flow process with higher conversion rates using microreactors.
