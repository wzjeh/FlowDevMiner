Microreactor technology is regarded as a promising process intensification strategy for chemical synthesis due to its unique characteristics, such as well-defined flow properties, high effec- tive surface-to-volume ratio, enhanced heatand mass-transfer rates, improved chemistry, and excellent process safety.1–3

Summary
 The paragraph discusses the importance of flow rate in controlling mixing performance in micromixers and microreactors. Due to their small dimensions and low volumetric flow rates, microstructured devices typically operate within the laminar flow regime. Engler et al.'s study on T-micromixers revealed three flow regimes: stratified flow, vortex flow, and engulfment flow with a Reynolds number below 200. Increasing flow rate leads to higher mixing quality due to increased vorticity and disturbance inside the T-junction of the micromixer.

Summary: The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process development for the synthesis of polymers using capillary microreactors. The reaction type is not mentioned explicitly but it involves the polymerization of monomers (Mn and PDI are properties of the resulting polymer). Key reactants/solvent/catalyst: Monomers, solvent (not specified), catalyst (also not specified). Products: Polymers. Reactor details: Capillary microreactors with an inner diameter of 1.016 mm. Critical conditions: Volumetric flow rate = 1.00 ml/min, polymerization temperature = 508C, and polymerization time = 7 min. Outcomes: The effect of pre-mixing time on Mn (molecular weight) and PDI (polydispersity index) is studied but no information about conversion, yield or selectivity is provided.

Microreactors are typically described as plug flow reactors. However, the plug flow in a channel is only valid when the radial diffusion is much faster than convective mass transport along the channel length.21,52 The Bodenstein number (Bo) in a dispersion model, provided by Taylor and Aris,21,53,54

1.548 mm indicating that deviations from plug flow were enhanced and the dispersion effect could not be ignored. The value of Bo decreased at the outlet of the microreactor com- paring with that at the inlet of the microreactor because of the decrease of the diffusion coefficient. That is, the deviations from plug flow increased gradually with the polymerization proceeding. The Taylor dispersion c
