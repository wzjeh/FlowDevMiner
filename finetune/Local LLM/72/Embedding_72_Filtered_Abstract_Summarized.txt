Step 1: Preprocess the paragraph to extract relevant information
The inner walls of a glass microreactor were functionalized in a one-step procedure with a single layer of a strong perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid. The applicability of the catalytic device was demonstrated in the successful hydrolysis of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal in acetonitrile, achieving quantitative conversion within a residence time of only 60 s.

Step 2: Identify relevant information
- reaction_type = "hydrolysis"
- reactants = ["benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal", "acetonitrile"]
- products = [null]
- conditions:
    - temperature = 80 °C (optimal)
    - residence_time = 60 s (not optimal, but present in the text; convert to min: 1 min)
    - flow_rate_reactant_A = null
    - flow_rate_reactant_B = null
    - pressure = null
- reactor:
