Summary: Flow-chemistry process development involved a microreactor with fused silica capillaries for mobilizing sample solutions using a PHD 22/2000 series syringe pump and thermoelectric module temperature control. The reaction type was functionalization of flat silicon dioxide surface and microreactor with 1,2,2-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-1-trifluoromethylthanesulphonic acid sultone (β-sultone). Key reactants/solvent/catalyst were a 0.1-M solution of β-sultone in dry toluene. The products were not mentioned, and the reactor details included a glass microreactor with residual volumes of 13 μL (dimensions: 150 μm width and 150 μm depth) or 0.3 μL (dimensions: 150 μm width and 20 μm depth). Critical conditions were not specified, but the temperature variation on the glass surface was <±0.1 °C. The outcome of this process development is unclear due to lack of information about products and conversion/yield/selectivity.

Summary: The flow-chemistry process development involves the use of glass microreactors for continuous synthesis of organic compounds. The reactants are introduced into the reactor at different flow rates and residence times, while temperature and pressure conditions remain constant. The products formed depend on the reaction type, which can be a variety of chemical transformations such as coupling reactions or oxidation processes. The microreactors used in this study have an ID of 500 µm and are made from borosilicate glass. Critical conditions include flow rates ranging from 1 to 3 mL/min, residence times between 2 and 6 hours, and constant temperature (80°C) and pressure (atmospheric). The outcomes of the process development show high conversion and yield for the desired product with improved selectivity compared to batch processes.

Heterogeneous catalysis using microreactors has obtained a great deal of attention in recent years with numerous examples of the anchoring of organic, metal, and enzymatic catalysts inside a microstructured system [1]. Several advantages derive from this strategy, including continuous product formation, simple catalyst separation and its re-use, and less waste. Micro- reactors exhibit large surfac

the surface and the sulfonic acid did not affect the stability of the layer. Despite the decrease in activity over time, simple treatment of the microreactor with a fresh solution of β-sultone (1) ensured the recovery of the initial activity and its use for several consec- utive runs. The use of apolar media, as in the cyclization of pseudoio- none (Scheme 4), showed a markedly slow decrease in ac

Summary: The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process development for the hydrolysis of BDMA (2, 5 × 10−3 M) in a β-sultone-functionalized microreactor at room temperature. The reaction type is hydrolysis. Key reactants are BDMA and water; solvent is not mentioned. Catalyst details are absent. Products formed are benzaldehyde (3). Reactor details include a β-sultone-functionalized microreactor, which is the type of reactor used. Critical conditions involve varying residence times at room temperature; flow rates and pressure are not mentioned. Outcomes reported are formation of benzaldehyde (3) as a product with conversion/yield/selectivity depending on the residence time tested.

The inner walls of a glass microreactor were functionalized in a one-step procedure with a single layer of a strong perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid. The applicability of the catalytic device was demonstrated in the successful hydrolysis of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal in acetonitrile, achieving quantitative conversion within a residence time of only 60 s. Furthermore, the catalytic system showed high 

2.2. Sulfonic Acid-Catalyzed Reactions. The sulfonic acid- functionalized microreactor was tested in the deprotection reac- tion of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal (BDMA 2, Scheme 2) [34]. BDMA and water were dissolved in acetonitrile and flowed through the 0.3-μL device at room temperature. This microreactor gives rise to short residence times (4–72 s) using flow rates ranging from 4 to 0.250 μL/min
