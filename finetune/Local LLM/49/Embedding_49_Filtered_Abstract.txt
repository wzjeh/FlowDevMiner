A schematic overview of the microchemical system is shown in Fig. 3. The reactants were delivered by metering pumps (Beijing Sa- tellite Co. Ltd.) from glass bottles and separately pumped into stainless steel capillaries with an inner diameter of 1.4 mm and an external diameter of 2 mm, representing the feed stream tubes. The feed streams were preheated to the reaction temperature and then mixed i

Fig. 4 shows the effect of temperature on the conversion of 1,3- DCP and 2,3-DCP within a range of 35–85 C at the residence time of 2 s and 10 s respectively. The conversion of 1,3-DCP can reach about 85% at 35 C and 2,3-DCP of 14% at 55 C in the microchem- ical system while the conversion of 1,3-DCP and 2,3-DCP at the same temperature are only about 10% and near zero respectively in the litera

aqueous solution containing an excess of Ca(OH)2 and offered a ki- netic model of the overall system using the techniques of potenti- ometry and gas chromatography. Ma et al. [14] studied the kinetics of dehydrochlorination of DCP (mainly 1,3-DCP) and the side reac- tion of ECH hydrolysis. The results indicate that both two reactions can be considered as second order reactions. But all the experi-

The samples were collected directly from the outlet of the microneutralizer. The samples were diluted and measured by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) with a flame ionization detector under following conditions: the injection temperature, 220 C; the column temperature, 70–220 C, 30 C/min; the detec- tor temperature, 280 C. The sample volume for all analysis was 2 lL. The dichloropropanol 

Experimental conditions: 1,3-DCP and 2,3-DCP solution (1 wt.% each): 10 ml/min; NaOH solution (0.65 wt.%): 5 ml/min; phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.0, 0.5 mol/L): 5 ml/min. The molar ratio of OH to DCP was 1.05 and the residence time of 1,3-DCP and 2,3- DCP were 2 s and 10 s, respectively. The micro-tubes for 1,3-DCP and 2,3-DCP were 0.32 m and 1.62 m, respectively.

Determination of kinetic parameters of dehydrochlorination of dichloropropanol in a microreactor

The reaction kinetics of dehydrochlorination of dichloropropanol (including 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol and 2,3-dichloro-1-propanol) is investigated with a microchemical system, which is constructed with a micromixer, a micro-tube and a microneutralizer. The reaction starts up by mixing dichloropropanol solution and sodium hydroxide solution in the micromixer, proceeds in the following micro-tube for

Fig. 6. Conversion of 2,3-DCP versus time at the temperature range of 50–80 C. Experimental conditions: 2,3-DCP solution (1 wt.%): 10 ml/min; NaOH solution (2 wt.%): 3.1 ml/min; phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.0, 0.5 mol/L): 10 ml/min. The molar ratio of OH to DCP was 2. The residence time was varied by changing the length of the reaction tube (0.14–5.54 m).
