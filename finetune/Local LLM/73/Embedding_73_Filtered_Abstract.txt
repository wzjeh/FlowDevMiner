Summary
 Flow-chemistry process development is a promising approach for microreactor technology in chemical engineering and processing. The focus is on continuous flow reactors with high shear rates, enabling precise control over reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, residence time distribution, and mixing. This leads to improved conversion, yield, selectivity, and reduced waste generation compared to batch processes. Microreactors offer advantages in terms of heat and mass transfer, allowing for the use of a wide range of reactants, solvents, catalysts, and products. The choice of reactor type (e.g., plug flow or continuous stirred-tank) depends on the reaction type and desired outcome. Critical conditions include flow rate(s), residence time, temperature, and pressure, which can be optimized for specific applications. Overall, microreactors offer a versatile platform for process intensification in chemical engineering and processing.
