Summary: The micro-packed-bed reactor is a flow-chemistry process development for continuous synthesis of organic compounds. It uses hydrogenation as the reaction type with water and methanol as key reactants, palladium on carbon as catalyst, and formaldehyde as product. The reactor is a micro-packed-bed reactor (ID 0.5mm) with a flow rate of 1mL/min, residence time of 360s, temperature of 80°C, and pressure of 2atm. The outcome shows high conversion (97%) and selectivity (>99%).

After mixing, the two phases flow into the micro-packed- bed reactor which is packed with palladium metal catalyst particles. At the rear end of the μPBR, a gas–liquid separation tank is connected to separate the gas and liquid phases. The upper part of the separatio

Besides, fluidized beds17 have been used to achieve high reaction rates and efficient catalyst utilization in industry. Despite these advancements, these methods often result in increased risks due to the high excessive use of hydrogen and the addition of active equipment. These challenges necessitate the deve
