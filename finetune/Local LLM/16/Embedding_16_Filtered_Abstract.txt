The heat transfer coeﬃcient has been tested in the magnitude of 10 kW m−2 K−1 and mass transfer coeﬃcient in the magnitude of 10 s−1 in the microreactor, which are two orders larger than those in a reported conven- tional reactor.10

Based on study of the process parameters, the reaction con- ditions were finally selected as HNO3 : aniline 1 molar ratio of 3.0 (HNO3: 6.0 ml min−1, aniline solution: 7.8 ml min−1), temperature of 60 °C and LH

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a continuous-flow microreactor system for one-step dinitration of aniline derivatives in flow chemistry. The reaction involves nitration of reactive species like aniline and phenol compounds using electrophilic or charge-transfer processes. The study employs a solution complementary to conventional batch or semi-batch modes, offering improved process safety, precise temperature control, large surface-to-volume ratios, and enhanced selectivity by suppressing side reactions. Microreactors are used due to their small dimensions, short diffusion paths, and high surface-to-volume ratios compared to batch reactors. The essential requirements of the microreaction system include one-step dinitration in a continuous-flow approach, precise reaction temperature control (variation between reaction temperature and fluid outlet temperature is less than 2 °C), avoidance of pre-protection of amino groups, elimination of sulfuric acid for downstream purification purposes. The microreactor system uses aniline derivatives as key reactants without any pre-protection or additional catalysts. The products are dinitroanilines with high conversion and yield rates. The reactor details include a continuous-flow microre

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for the synthesis of dinitro herbicides using nitric acid as both the nitrating agent and solvent in a microreactor. The reaction is a one-step dinitration, producing di-nitro compounds with high selectivity. The key reactants are aromatic amines and nitric acid, which acts as both catalyst and solvent. The reactor used is a continuous-flow microreactor with a residence time of 10 minutes at room temperature (25°C). The flow rate is not mentioned in the paragraph. The critical conditions are a pressure of 3 bar and a nitric acid concentration of 40%. The conversion, yield, and selectivity of the process were not reported in this summary.

out the reaction. Benefiting from the short residence time, 1e was not determined in all cases (Table 1), and the fluid outlet temperatures were almost the same as the reaction tempera- ture, the variations of temperature were always within 2 °C. We observed that 85% conversion was obtained with 98% HNO3, while only 24% conversion was achieved with 65% HNO3 (entries 1–3, Table 1). Bearing in mind 

virtue of short residence time. When the HNO3 concentration is changed from 98% to 65%, the molar ratio of 1a : 1b in the products can switch from 0.2 to 4.2, which greatly benefit downstream processing. It is worth noting that pendimethalin can be produced at 4.32 t per year via this microreactor, and industrial-scale production can be realized by numbering-up principle. Finally, it should be emp
