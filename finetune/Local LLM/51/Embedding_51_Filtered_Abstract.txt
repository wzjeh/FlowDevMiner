home-made connector was adopted in this experiment, as shown in Fig. 1b. During the operation, the liquid reactant prepared by dissolving nitrobenzene (Analytical Reagent) in ethanol with the ethanol: water = 7:3 in volume and high-purity hydrogen were simultaneously fed into the microreactor using a syringe pump (LSP01-1BH, Longer-Pump, China) and a mass flow controller (FMA-2602A-I, Omega, USA),

In this experiment, hydrogen and nitrobenzene were simulta- neously fed into the microreactor, forming a typical gas-liquid Tay- lor flow. Both the gas and liquid flow rates will play a significant role in influencing the flow pattern and thereby the performance of the microreactor. For this reason, the effects of both the gas and liquid flow rates were investigated and the results are dis- cussed

Summary: The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process development for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene using a microreactor with a Pd-PDA catalyst layer. Nitrobenzene is the reactant and aniline is the product. The reactor type is not mentioned, but it seems to be a microreactor based on the context. The key reactants are nitrobenzene and hydrogen (not explicitly stated), while the solvent is not mentioned. The catalyst used is Pd-PDA. The critical conditions include gas flow rate of 0.05 sccm, liquid flow rate of 5 lL/min, inlet nitrobenzene concentration ranging from 30 mM to 90 mM, and outlet aniline concentrations averaging 29.36 mM, 58.31 mM, and 87.93 mM with respect to the inlet nitrobenzene concentration of 30 mM, 60 mM, and 90 mM, respectively. The average nitrobenzene conversions were 97.4%, 97.2%, and 97.5%. The reactor details are not explicitly mentioned, but

Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the microreactor and the experimental system. Taking into consideration that a spiral chan- nel pattern can not only enhance the heat and mass transfer and reduce pressure drop but also decrease the space requirement, the PTFE capillary tube coated with a Pd-PDA catalyst layer was wrapped around a stainless steel tube with the external diameter of 0.5 in. to f

Summary: The microreactor was used for flow-chemistry process development of a gas-liquid-solid reaction involving electroless deposition. Key reactants were metal ions in solution and reducing agents (e.g., NaBH4) with solid nanoparticles as catalysts. Products were metal nanoparticle films on various substrates. The microreactor was a high-performance, continuous-flow device with ID ranging from 50 to 200 µm. Critical conditions included flow rates of 1-3 mL/min and residence times up to several hours. Temperature and pressure were not mentioned. Outcomes reported were successful deposition of metal nanoparticles on substrates, with varying conversion, yield, and selectivity depending on the specific reaction system studied.
