system.8 A major objective of the research was to identify the gas-liquid flow rate. Therefore, experiments were carried out under diﬀerent gas flow rates and liquid flow rates. As can be seen from Table 3, when hydrogen flow rate was 20 sccm, >99.9 conversion of substrate and high selectivity of product can be obtained at relatively lower liquid flow rates. The hydrogen flow rate was increased su

Experiment conditions: Concentration = 0.118 M; Reaction temperature = 60 °C; Reaction pressure = 2 MPa; VG = 60 sccm; VL = 1.0 mL/min; Reactor volume = 6.6 mL; VL is the liquid flow rate; VG is the hydrogen flow rate. Conv. is conversion, Conversion ¼ C0Ca C0 , C0 is the original concen- tration of 4-TFMNB and 2-TFMNB in the reactant, Ca is the concentration of 4-TFMNB and 2-TFMNB in the product

overview of the continuous flow system is shown in Figure 3. The ¯PBR was comprised of two sections: a stainless steel pipe and the catalyst. Stainless steel tubes were inert to solvent and catalyst components. In addition, they can work well over a wide range of temperature and pressure. Pictures and detailed parameters of the ¯PBR are provided in Figure S2, Table S2 and Table S3. Solvents have g
