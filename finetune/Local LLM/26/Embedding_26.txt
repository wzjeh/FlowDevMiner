Micropacked beds (MPBs) are derived from the miniaturization of trickle bed reactors (Losey et al., 2001; Cao et al., 2021), which

have attracted substantial attentions (Nuzhdin et al., 2015; Vilé et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017). Compared with conventional trickle bed reactors, MPBs have the small dimensional scale and are packed with small particles (diameters < 500 lm) (Ranade et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2018), which exhibit the advantages of high surface-to-volume ratio, enhanced mass transfer, fast multi- phase mixing, and excellent operating safety (Liu et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2019). At present, MPBs have been widely applied in

The overall external mass transfer performance was measured by the hydrogenation of AMS in methylcyclohexane (Shanghai Meryer Chemical Technology Co., Ltd., China) with the same exper- imental setup as the catalyst performance test in Section 2.2. The mass transfer performance of MPB both packed with monolithic catalysts and particle catalysts was investigated. The reaction tem- perature, pressure, AMS initial concentration, and gas flow rate were set as 30 C, 0.6 MPa, 10 wt%, and 20 mLmin1, respectively. The AMS hydrogenation is an extremely fast reaction and enables to reach a fully mass transfer limited regime even at moderate temperature and pressure (Meille et al., 2004; Lévêque et al., 2016). Assuming a plug flow model, the apparent rate of reaction (ra) can be determined by an integration of a steady state mass bal- ance over the whole catalysts (Tourvieille et al., 2013; Tourvieille et al., 2015). The apparent rate can be expressed in terms of the AMS conversion and the liquid flow rate, as shown in equation (1) (Haase et al., 2013; Sang et al., 2020).

less steel, and the inner diameter, outer diameter, and length were 3.8, 6.4, and 80.0 mm, respectively. Four pieces of monolithic cat- alysts were packed in the middle of the MPB, and other parts of the MPB were packed with untreated nickel foams. AMS dissolved in methanol (Shanghai Titan Technology Co., Ltd., China) was pumped and mixed with pure hydrogen from reg- ulated cylinder, and then flowed into the MPB. The MPB was installed in a water bath to control the reaction temperature (T) at 70 C, and a back pressure regulator was employed to control the system pressure (P) at 1.0 MPa. AMS initial concentration (CAMS) and the gas flow rate (G) were set as 10 wt% and 20 mLmin1, respectively. The liquid flow rate (Q) of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mLmin1 was chosen in the experiments. When the reaction was stable, the liquid samples from the outlet of MPB were collected, diluted, and then analyzed by a gas chro- matography (GC, 8860, Agilent Technologies Co., Ltd., U.S.) with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary column (HP-5, 30 m  0.32 mm  0.25 lm). The same MPB packed with Pd/Al2O3 particle catalysts was employed in this work for the comparison of hydrogenation perfor- mance. The catalysts were prepared by loading active component Pd on Al2O3 particles with the same method in Section 2.1. The Pd concentration of catalysts was controlled as 0.3 wt%, and the catalysts with 0.04 g were used for the similar content of Pd as the monolithic catalysts. The diameter of Al2O3 particles was about 460 lm, by which the similar channels as the nickel foam can be created. The particle catalysts were also packed in the middle of MPB, and other parts of the MPB were packed with blank Al2O3 particles.

Fig. 10 shows the effect of liquid superficial velocity on the overall external mass transfer coefficient of the MPB with particle catalysts and monolithic catalysts. The kOV increased with the increase of liquid superficial velocity, because the liquid turbulence and liquid renewal rate were enhanced at high liquid superficial velocity. This can lead to the improvement of gas–liquid and liq- uid–solid contact areas and the intensification of gas–liquid and liquid–solid mass transfer processes.

3.2.1. Catalyst activity The hydrogenation reaction was performed in the MPB with the similar Pd content of about 0.00012 g for both particle catalysts and monolithic catalysts. The effect of liquid flow rate on the activ- ity of particle catalysts and monolithic catalysts is shown in Fig. 7. The AMS conversion decreased with the increase of liquid flow rate. Although the increase of liquid flow rate may improve the mass transfer efficiency, AMS cannot contact adequately with Pd sites and flows directly through the reactor at high liquid flow rate. With increasing the liquid flow rate, the residence time of liquid reactant decreased. The decreasing tendency of conversion at high liquid flow rate was not significant than that at low liquid flow rate. Comparing the activity of the monolithic catalysts with the same content of Pd, the catalysts with Pd/CeO2 and Pd/CaCO3 coat- ings had the highest and lowest AMS conversion, respectively. The catalysts with Pd/Al2O3, Pd/SiO2, and Pd/TiO2 coatings had little difference in AMS conversion. The possible reason is that there was difference in the textural properties between the coatings, and the capabilities of the coatings for the combination and storage of gas and liquid reactants were also different. Besides, the unifor-
