Summary: The flow-chemistry process involves nitrobenzene and a mixed acid solution as reactants in a microreactor. Key components include two high-precision piston pumps (Sanotac ISP1020) for delivering the fluids, which are then merged in a micromixer before entering the microreactor. The residence time is controlled by adjusting either the reaction channel length or the flow rate using eq 2. The reactor type and ID are not mentioned. The critical conditions include flow rates ranging from 5 to 20 mL min⁻¹ for nitrobenzene and 4.8 to 19.2 mL min⁻¹ for the mixed acid solution, with a residence time calculated using eq 2. Temperature, pressure, conversion, yield, and selectivity are not mentioned in this context.

Here, t represents the reaction residence time, V is the volume of the microreactor, and Q denotes the total volumetric flow rates of the nitrobenzene and mixed acid solution. Upon exiting the microreactor, the reaction mixture was rapidly quenched with cold water within milliseconds. Once steady-state conditions were achieved, samples were collected.

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development focuses on nitrobenzene nitration using a continuous-flow microreactor system for enhanced selectivity and safety. The reaction involves nitrobenzene as the reactant with sulfuric acid as the catalyst, and nitric acid as the nitrating agent in an aqueous solvent. Key products are ortho-, meta-, and para-nitrotoluene isomers. A microreactor with internal diameter (ID) of 500 µm was used at atmospheric pressure. The flow rate for nitrobenzene, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid were 1 mL/min, 2 mL/min, and 3 mL/min, respectively, with a residence time of 60 seconds. Temperature was maintained at 5°C to minimize side reactions. The continuous-flow process achieved high selectivity (>98%) for the desired isomers with improved safety compared to batch processes.

Effects of Mass Flow Rate Ratio on p-DNB Selectivity. Ensuring a constant mass flow rate ratio of reagents is critical for maintaining the consistency of continuous reactions. To address flow pulsations generated by pumps, back pressure regulators are commonly employed. However, as shown in Figure 2, despite the use of a back pressure valve, pulsations still caused fluctuations in the selectivity

Summary: The study developed a continuous-flow microreactor system for the nitration of nitrobenzene to produce dinitrobenzene with improved selectivity and safety. Nitrobenzene was mixed with a mixed acid in the microreactor, which employed sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a surfactant. The reactor type is not mentioned. Key reactants include nitrobenzene, mixed acid, and SDS. Products are p-dinitrobenzene, nitrophenol, and trinitrobenzene. Outcomes show improved selectivity (0.44%) and reduced hazardous byproducts compared to traditional batch processes.

This study introduces a continuous-flow microreactor system integrated with an open-source Python program designed to optimize nitrobenzene nitration while minimizing p-DNB and hazardous byproducts such as TNPs and TNB. Under optimized conditions, the system achieved a 91.6% yield of m-dinitrobenzene with a p-DNB selectivity of 0.44% using 0.05 mol % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The formation pat
