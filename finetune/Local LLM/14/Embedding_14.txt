where QMA represents the mass flow rate of mixed acid, QNB is the mass flow rate of nitrobenzene, and f denotes the mass flow rate ratio or the feed ratio. Nitrobenzene (flow rate: 5−20 mL min−1) and the mixed acid solution (flow rate: 4.8−19.2 mL min−1) were separately delivered by two high-precision piston pumps (Sanotac ISP1020). The fluids were then merged in a micromixer before entering the microreactor, where they remained for several seconds. The residence time was controlled by adjusting either the reaction channel length or the flow rate and was calculated using eq 2.

Continuous-Flow Microreactor System for Enhanced Selectivity and Safety in Nitrobenzene Nitration

Effects of Mass Flow Rate Ratio on p-DNB Selectivity. Ensuring a constant mass flow rate ratio of reagents is critical for maintaining the consistency of continuous reactions. To address flow pulsations generated by pumps, back pressure regulators are commonly employed. However, as shown in Figure 2, despite the use of a back pressure valve, pulsations still caused fluctuations in the selectivity of p-DNB. Addition- ally, changing reaction conditions often requires manual readjustment of multiple pump flow rates to achieve proper material matching. Seasonal temperature variations in the laboratory, the presence of high-viscosity reagents, and internal wear of pump components further exacerbate the issue, resulting in discrepancies between the actual and indicated flow rates. We present an open-source Python program that facilitates precise control of the mass flow rate ratio for two or more reagent streams entering a reactor. The program is highly adaptable and user-friendly. When reaction conditions change, users can simply set the desired feed ratio via the program interface, which then automatically adjusts the flow rates to maintain the specified ratio (Figure S1). The control principle is illustrated in Figure 1. By applying a PID control algorithm, the mass flow rate ratio between nitrobenzene and mixed acid was dynamically adjusted in real-time, achieving a stable ratio close to the target value of 1.90. Under identical experimental conditions, this precise control resulted in both lower and more stable p- DNB selectivity compared to operations with fixed pump flow rates, as demonstrated in Figure 2. This approach significantly enhances the reproducibility and reliability of the flow chemistry process, making it a robust solution for continuous reaction systems. Effects of Reaction Conditions on p-DNB Selectivity. Based on previous work,1 the optimal conditions for the nitration of nitrobenzene to achieve the highest yield of m- dinitrobenzene (m-DNB) were determined to be a reaction temperature of 70 °C and a residence time of 4 min, resulting in a dinitrobenzene yield of 99% and an m-DNB selectivity of 90.88%. However, the prior study did not investigate how the selectivity of p-dinitrobenzene (p-DNB) varies with reaction conditions. Maintaining p-DNB at a low level may significantly

ABSTRACT: Dinitrobenzene, a crucial intermediate in pesticide and dye production, is typically synthesized through the exothermic nitration of nitrobenzene. This study presents a continuous-flow microreactor system integrated with micromixers to enhance selectivity and safety in the nitration process. An open-source Python program was developed to precisely control the mass flow rate ratio of nitrobenzene to the mixed acid. By optimizing reaction conditions and employing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a surfactant, the selectivity of p-dinitrobenzene was minimized to 0.44%, while hazardous nitrophenol byproducts were reduced to 112 ppma significant improvement compared to the 509 ppm observed in traditional batch processes. Compared to traditional batch reactors, the microreactor system significantly lowered p-dinitrobenzene selectivity and mini- mized nitrophenol and trinitrobenzene formation, highlighting its suitability for industrial-scale applications. ■INTRODUCTION m-Dinitrobenzene (m-DNB) is a crucial intermediate in the production of pesticides, dyes, and polymerization initiators.1

This study introduces a continuous-flow microreactor system integrated with an open-source Python program designed to optimize nitrobenzene nitration while minimizing p-DNB and hazardous byproducts such as TNPs and TNB. Under optimized conditions, the system achieved a 91.6% yield of m-dinitrobenzene with a p-DNB selectivity of 0.44% using 0.05 mol % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The formation pathway of nitrophenols during nitration was elucidated, and by maintaining sulfuric acid concentrations below 74.5%, nitro- phenol and TNB formation were significantly suppressed. Compared to traditional batch reactors, the microreactor system demonstrated reduced TNP levels (112 ppm) and a shorter residence time (4 min), highlighting its superior safety and efficiency. Under the optimized conditions, p-DNB content can be significantly reduced, but the production capacity per unit reactor remains limited to 0.5 kg/h. Enhancing reactor throughput is crucial for future industrial applications. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
