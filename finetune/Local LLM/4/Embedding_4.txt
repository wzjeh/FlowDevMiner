was mainly a result of the fixed reactor tube length of 5.0 m in the ex­ periments. With the given tube length the residence time of reactants in the microchannel reduced with the increase in gas flow rate, thus total flow rate. It was observed that under these operating conditions, the effects of the reduction in residence time on the yield of benzaldehyde were significantly stronger than that of the enhancement of mass transfer process, therefore, the yield of benzaldehyde decreased. Under these experimental conditions, the optimal yield of benzaldehyde was found at the gas–liquid volumetric flow rate ratio of 99 for both tem­ perature levels of 393 K and 403 K.

where Vm is the reactor volume, Q is the total volume flow rate of gas–liquid phase. To mitigate the impact of unsteady state conditions on reaction performance, the double residence time was implemented for at least one run prior to collecting the sample. The reaction solution at the outlet of the microchannel reactor was collected in a gas–liquid sepa­ rator prior to further chemical analysis. Each experiment was repeated independently more than three times to ensure data accuracy. All

3.2.7. Effects of the reactor tube inner diameter It is well known that the size of the reactor tube inner diameter has a great influence on the gas–liquid flow dynamics in the microchannel as the linear velocity of the fluid changes at a given volumetric flow rate, that further affect the mass transfer and ultimately the reaction out­ comes. Fig. 14 depicted the influence of the reactor tube inner diameter on the yield of the benzaldehyde and the flow state within the micro­ channel operated at a constant volumetric flow rate. When the reactor tube inner diameter decreased from 1.59 mm to 0.5 mm, the yield of benzaldehyde increased approximately in linear from 14.67% to 35.39%. This was primarily due to the fact that the mixing process in the liquid phase and the mass transfer process between two phases were enhanced by decreasing the inner diameter of microchannel. Firstly, as the total volumetric flow rate and gas–liquid flow rate ratio were kept constant (e.g., 99 μL/min), the overall apparent linear velocity increased with the decrease of the inner diameter. Subsequently, the internal circulation and mixing in the liquid plug were enhanced, as discussed above, which accelerated the regeneration rate of the liquid film side at the gas–liquid phase interface and enhanced the mass transfer in the liquid phase. Secondly, when the tube inner diameter decreased, the formation frequencies of bubbles and liquid plugs increased, on the contrary, the lengths of bubbles and liquid plugs decreased accordingly, as evidenced in the experiments with the inner diameters of 0.5 and 1.59 mm displayed in Fig. 14(b). In that case, the specific phase interface area between the gas and liquid phases and the mass transfer rate of O2 to the liquid phase increased, respectively. Finally, in order to keep the total volume of the microchannel constant, the length of the tube must be extended due to the reduction of its inner diameter. The pressure drop

benzaldehyde. As the tube length increased with longer residence time and further progress of reaction, secondly, more gas phase oxygen was consumed, leading to a decrease in the total volumetric flow rate of the multiphase flow, as shown in Fig. 11(c). Finally, the pressure drop along the reactor microchannel exhibited an increase trend with the increase of tube length as expected. That was advantageous for the diffusion of oxygen molecules into a continuous aqueous phase and had a positive impact on the yield of benzaldehyde. Under experimental operating conditions, in general, the three factors discussed above actively inter­ acted together to promote the conversion of benzyl alcohol and increase the yield of benzaldehyde in the microchannel reactor.

3.2.5. Effects of total volumetric flow rate With a given residence time and constant tube diameter, a longer tube is needed to achieve a higher total volumetric flow rate. However, varying total volumetric flow rate may have more complicated influence on hydrodynamics, mass transfer and ultimately the reaction. Therefore, this was more closely investigated. Fig. 12 depicts the profiles of product yield as a function of total flow rate at three temperature levels, and visual observation. As seen in Fig. 12(a), at a given reaction temperature the product yield profile changed through two stages, a rapid increase followed by

leveling off at a relatively stable level, with the increase of total volu­ metric flow rate. The critical turning point was around the total volu­ metric flow rate of 820 μL/min in all three profiles. Also, a higher temperature resulted in a higher yield while all three profiles of product yield showed a similar trend. As discussed, in order to keep a constant residence time, different lengths of tubes with a given inner diameter were used at different total volumetric flow rates. It was observed that when the total flow rate increased at a given gas–liquid flow ratio, the length of gas bubbles decreased noticeably, from 2.51 mm to 1.95 mm in responding to the total flow rate increase from 550 μL/min to 1720 μL/min, as observed in the middle of the reactor tube (Fig. 12(b)). This reduction in gas bubble size further led to an increase in the interfacial area between gas and emulsion phases, thus enhancing interfacial mass transfer performance. This was in line with the above investigation on the effect of tube length (Fig. 11(c)). Furthermore, this flow pattern change enhanced the in­ ternal circulation of liquid plug and mass transfer across gas–liquid interface with the increase of the total volume flow rate. Therefore, the conversion of benzyl alcohol and the yield of benzaldehyde increased with the increase of the total volume flow rate (<820 μL/min). When the volume flow rate was greater than 820 μL/min, the yield of benzalde­ hyde was almost unchanged with the increase of the total volume flow rate. This indicated that the effect of the mass transfer resistance on the conversion of benzyl alcohol could be neglected at the higher total volume flow rates (greater than 820 μL/min), and the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol was controlled by the intrinsic kinetics in the range of the total volumetric flow rate.

Over the past few decades, the microchannel reactor technology has advanced considerably, exhibiting remarkable performance in chemical process intensification [1–3]. Compared to conventional batch or semi batch reactors on a macroscale, microchannel reactors possess numerous advantages, including a considerable specific surface area, rapid heat and mass transfer rates, minimal back-mixing (resulting in a plug flow reactor), intrinsic process safety, and scalability through numbering-up [4–11]. Despite these advantages, there are still some key challenges for wider applications of multiphase reactions involving gas–liquid-solid or solid–liquid systems, that are mainly associated with the significant fouling and clogging with microchannels caused by solid particulate materials [12]. This is of direct relevance to heterogeneous solid catalytic reaction processes which occupy a very large proportion of reactions in the chemical industry [13,14]. Therefore, enormous ef­ forts have been made to improve continuous multiphase flow reaction systems involving solid catalyst particles in microchannels [15]. One of the most commonly employed strategies to solve the packing problem of solid catalyst materials is to have the solid particles adhered
