of 4-NP, during which the inlet concentration of 4-NP was fixed at 1 mM. As shown in Fig. 6b, the Pd-30/UiO-66-NH2 microreactor with 0.10 wt% Pd shows over 99.1% conversion towards 4-NP at the flow rate of 10 μL/min. However, the conversion gradually decreased when increasing the flow rate from 10 to 60 μL/min, and the corresponding UV–vis spectra are shown in Fig. 6c. It is not surprising that the con- version is highest at the lowest flow rate, as the flow rate is opposite to the residence time, which reflects the contact time of the reactants with active components [29–30]. Thus, increasing the flow rate means

decreasing the residence time, leading to the decline of conversion. Compared with Pd-30/UiO-66-NH2 microreactor, the conversions of 4- NP catalyzed by Pd-60/UiO-66-NH2 (Pd loading: 0.19 wt%) are nearly 100% at the flow rates ranging from 10 to 40 μL/min, and it slightly declines to 99.4% and 98.5% when the flow rate shifts to 50 and 60 μL/ min, respectively (Fig. 6d). It is easy to understand that the Pd-60/UiO- 66-NH2 microreactor can provide enough Pd active components for the reaction, resulting in outstanding catalytic performance at the same condition. Generally speaking, long-term stability is an essential requirement for the industrial application of capillary reactors. To evaluate the stability of the microreactor, the long-term catalytic performance of Pd- 60/UiO-66-NH2 capillary microreactor was carried out at the flow rate of 30 μL/min and the inlet 4-NP concentration of 1 mM. The long-term operation was conducted for 100 h, during which samples of the outlet were collected every 2 h. Surprisingly, the conversion was always kept at nearly 100% during the entire reaction as shown in Fig. 7a, and this result demonstrates that the capillary microreactor is not only highly eﬃcient but also rather stable for the reduction reaction. SEM image of the surface view from spent Pd-60/UiO-66-NH2 film shows that this film does not peel oﬀand is not destroyed despite long-time running (Fig. 7b). From cross-sectional EDX mapping analysis (Fig. 7c), the Pd NPs are still uniformly dispersed in the UiO-66-NH2 film. These results further confirm the excellent stability of the composite structures. The excellent stability is supposed to originate from the fact that the Pd NPs are firmly embedded in the strongly adhered UiO-66-NH2 film, which should naturally be attributed to our artful strategy for film growth and the high eﬃciency of UiO-66-NH2 for the immobilizing Pd NPs. The above results indicate that the prepared microreactor is a highly eﬃcient, stable and feasible micro-device, which has great potential to be applied for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in practical applications.

As shown in Fig. 2, the resulting Pd/UiO-66-NH2 film microreactor was installed into the setup. 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) aqueous solution and freshly prepared NaBH4 solution were continuously fed into a tee joint at the same flow rate by two syringe pumps, respectively, and they were mixed into the film microreactor for the reduction reaction at 298 K. The residence time of the reaction was controlled by varying the total flow rate of mixtures in the microreactor. The total flow rate was set as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 μL/min, which corresponded to the residence time of 5.31, 2.66, 1.77, 1.33, 1.06 and 0.88 min, respectively. The products, collected from the microreactor outlet, were analyzed by re- cording absorbance at 399 nm in a quartz cuvette using UV–vis

DI water was inleted by a flow rate of 3 mL/h to wash the channel for 5 min to remove the unstably immobilized Pd species. Thereafter, fresh NaBH4 aqueous solution (10 mM) was introduced at the flow rate of 2 mL/h for 3 h to reduce the Pd species into Pd NPs. Finally, the pre- pared microreactor was washed again by DI water at the flow rate of 3 mL/h for 30 min and dried at 373 K for 12 h to achieve Pd/UiO-66- NH2 film capillary microreactors for the following characterization and reaction.

Flow fabrication of a highly eﬃcient Pd/UiO-66-NH2 film capillary microreactor for 4-nitrophenol reduction

299 nm could be observed. The fractional conversion of 4-NP was cal- culated to be as high as 100%. This reveals that Pd NPs act as catalytic components on the UiO-66-NH2 film and show extremely high catalytic activity in this reduction reaction. In a microreactor, flow rate has a vital influence on the reaction conversion. To illustrate the dependency between conversion and flow rate, two microreactors with diﬀerent Pd contents (marked as Pd-30/ UiO-66-NH2 and Pd-60/UiO-66-NH2) have been prepared by changing the flow time for Pd NPs immobilization and then used in the reduction
