Flow-chemistry process development: A microreactor was used for the synthesis of polycaprolactone (PCL) from benzyl alcohol and ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) under controlled temperature conditions. The reactor had a volume of W × D × L, with fixed flow rates for toluene-d8/benzyl alcohol mixture and ε-CL at a 2:1 ratio. Reaction time was estimated using the residence time equation V(1 - ε)/Q. Temperature uniformity was maintained by intermittently measuring interior temperature with a thermocouple, and variability was controlled within ±0.5 °C. The reactor type/ID is not mentioned in this context. Critical conditions include fixed flow rates for reactants, residence time estimation based on volume and flow rate, and controlled temperature (±0.5 °C). Outcomes are not specified in the given context.

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development using microreactors has shown benefits in polymerizations compared to batch reactor systems. For example, free radical polymerizations in microchannel flow systems resulted in products with lower polydispersity indices (PDIs) than those synthesized in batch reactors due to improved temperature control. Homopolymerizations of NCA-amino acid monomers conducted in microreactors yielded higher molecular weights and lower PDIs compared to their batch counterparts.

Flow-chemistry process development: ε-CL conversion study in a microreactor compared to batch reactor. Reaction type: polymerization of N435 catalyst with PCL monomer. Key reactants/solvent/catalyst: N435, PCL, and water as solvent. Products: PCL polymers. Microreactor details (type/ID): not mentioned. Critical conditions: flow rate(s) - not mentioned; residence time - not mentioned; temperature - 60°C; pressure - atmospheric pressure. Outcomes: conversion, yield, and selectivity are improved in the microreactor compared to batch reactor due to higher catalyst surface area to reaction volume ratio, shorter diffusion path length, and increased catalyst loading density.

In this study, the synthesis of end-functionalized oligomers of PCL was studied using a microreactor system consisting of high catalyst surface area due to microchannels packed with macroporous immobilized N435 beads. The model initiator, benzyl alcohol, was used to probe initiator reaction eﬃciency. Results from this work can guide other studies where end groups consist of bioactive molecules at

Flow-chemistry process development: 
Reaction type: Microreactor synthesis of polyester with benzyl ester chain ends
Key reactants: epsilon-caprolactone (ε-CL), benzyl alcohol (BzOH)
Solvent/Catalyst: Toluene-d8, N435 reusability for BzOH end-functionalized PCL synthesis
Products: Benzyl ester chain ends in polyester
Reactor details: Microreactor system with 90 mL reaction mixture and flow rate of 65 μL/s
Critical conditions: Reaction time of 120 s, maximum % ε-CL conversion reached within this time frame
Outcomes: Percentage of benzyl ester chain ends in polyester increased to >98% under "water saturated" conditions compared to <0.2% under "dry" conditions. The decrease in percentage of benzyl ester chain ends over 30 cycles was larger for the "dry" system, indicating water depletion and decreased enzyme activity.

Summary: The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process developed for the synthesis of polycaprolactone (PCL) using N435 as a catalyst. The reaction is carried out in a microreactor at 70 °C with continuous PCL synthesis. Key reactants include bisphenol A and ethylene oxide, while the solvent used is toluene. The product obtained is poly(ε-caprolactone). The reactor type is not mentioned, but it is referred to as a microreactor with an ID. The critical conditions are not specified in this paragraph. However, the outcomes of the process are presented: % ε-CL conversion, Mn, and fractional content of benzyl ester groups at PCL chain ends.

These reasons have stimulated researchers to develop and study microreactor systems. Work has begun to explore the benefits of enzymes immobilized on solid supports packed within microchannels with special interest in the development of biotransformations for the synthesis of molecules for therapeutic applications.21,22

ABSTRACT: An enzyme packed microreactor was compared with a batch reactor system to determine eﬀects of reaction water content on immobilized Candida antarctica Lipase B (Novozyme 435, N435) reusability, eﬃciency of end-group functionalization, apparent monomer conversion rate con- stants (kapp), average molar mass (Mn), and leaching of Candida antarctica Lipase B (CALB) from Lewatit macro- porous

Flow-chemistry process development: A microreactor system was used for the esterification of benzyl alcohol with polycaprolactone (PCL) chain ends under "dry" conditions. The key reactants were benzyl alcohol and PCL, with a catalyst present but not specified. The products were end-functionalized PCL chains with benzyl ester C-terminal groups. The reactor type was microreactor (not specified further), and the residence time ranged from 15 to 90 s. Temperature, pressure, and flow rates are not mentioned in this context. The outcome of the study showed that the extent of end-functionalization for "dry" and "water saturated" systems was nearly identical, indicating similar Mn versus conversion results.
