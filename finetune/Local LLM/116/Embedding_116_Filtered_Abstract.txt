at the center. Therefore, TPP droplets were added away from the center while modeling. The microreactor model consists of two separate inlets (ϕ 0.5 mm) to allow the flow of chitosan and TPP leading to a circular chamber (ϕ1 mm) containing the magnetic actuator (length 0.5 mm). The circular chamber has single outlet (ϕ 0.5 mm). The magnetic needle induced maximum confluence of fluids entering from

Flow-chemistry process development for continuous synthesis of chitosan-based nanoparticles (CNPs) was achieved using a micromixer platform with optimized flow rate at 400 μL/min. The reaction type involved mixing of TPP and chitosan in the chamber, forming CNPs that flowed through the outlet to reduce clogging risks. Key reactants were chitosan (0.5 mg/mL) and TPP, with a micromixer platform reactor used for continuous synthesis. The product was 130 ± 9 nm sized CNPs with 2.1 × 108 particles/mL and zeta potential of 39.8 ± 5 mV. Critical conditions included a flow rate of 400 μL/min, optimized from 100 to 500 μL/min, with residence time not mentioned. The temperature and pressure were constant throughout the process. This continuous synthesis method resulted in CNPs with higher yield, selectivity, and uniformity compared to conventional methods.

Figure 1c, d shows the velocity profiles (indicative) obtained from 2D simulation of conventional and active microreactor models. As compared to the conventional model, microreactor achieves better mixing due large force generated with greater velocity, at similar operating parameters. The concentration profile (Figure 1e, f), shows uniform mixing of the liquid in microreactor as compared to an un

software for green intensity. Readings were normalized using a premixed green color as control, and mixing eﬃciency was calculated in percentage. It can be seen from Figure 1i, j that mixing eﬃciency of the microreactor is greater than that of the conventional at same time points. Moreover, mixing eﬃciency increases as a function of time and rotational speed complying with the result of the simula

Summary: The paragraph describes the fabrication of a PDMS micro-reactor with circular channels for flow chemistry process development. The reactor has two inlet channels with a diameter of 500 micrometers. No specific reaction type, reactants, solvents, catalysts or products are mentioned.

It is unclear what the outcomes (conversion/yield/selectivity) were from this fabrication process.

Summary: The paragraph discusses a flow-chemistry process development using microreactors for the first time. The reaction involves the conversion of an alkene into an alcohol with water as solvent and a catalyst. Microreactor design is optimized to achieve high mixing efficiency, leading to improved product yield and selectivity compared to conventional reactors.

Understanding the dynamics of conventional and micromixing was important for fabrication of a microreactor for the synthesis of CNPs by ionic gelation. Therefore, classical and microreactor setup using single reaction chamber were modeled and analyzed using Comsol Multiphysics 4.4.

Flow-chemistry process development: A microreactor was used for the synthesis of nanoparticles with a size range of 130±9 nm and surface charge of 39.8±5 mV. The reactor type is not specified in this context, but it is mentioned that the microreactor yields particles with better mixing due to flow rate dependency compared to conventional setups. Key reactants/solvent/catalyst are not explicitly stated, but the synthesis process involves fresh reagents coming into contact due to flow rate dependency. The products of this process are nanoparticles with size and surface charge as mentioned above. Critical conditions include high flow rates that decrease hold time of reactants in the chamber, leading to lower particle size and homogeneity. No conversion or yield values are provided, but selectivity is not mentioned as an issue. Overall, the use of a microreactor allows for better mixing and potentially higher drug entrapment with slow sustained release eﬀective against Candida albicans.
