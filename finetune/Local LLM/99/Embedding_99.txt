The microreactor is equipped with three inlet ports for H2, O2, and the solvent, a single outlet port, a gas−liquid mixing zone, a packed bed section, and six DAMS units to prevent catalyst backflow into the gas−liquid mixing zone and out of the microreactor. The width of the gas−liquid inlet is 200 μm, with a depth of 250 μm. The gas mixing channel and the filler bed channel, both 800 μm in depth and width, are interconnected by a dam measuring 2000 μm in length, 800 μm in width, and 100 μm in depth. The dam, which is smaller than the catalyst particles, is positioned at the entrance of the catalyst inlet to prevent backflow of catalyst particles into the gas mixing zone during filling. Additionally, five dams of identical size are situated at the outlet to trap any catalyst particles. The fluid flow rate is controlled by a high-precision injection pump (LD-P2020, Shanghai Lande Medical Instruments Co., Ltd., China) in conjunction with a 30 mL syringe (BD Plastic, Jiangxi Fenglin Medical Instruments Co., Ltd., China). The gas flow rate is regulated by a mass flow controller (MFC model CS200A, Beijing Seven Star Huachuang Electronics Co., Ltd., China). Prior to use, nitrogen (N2) is employed to test the microreactor for leaks. Following this, the reaction mixture (CH3OH + H2SO4 + NaBr) undergoes acidification for 30 min. Subsequently, H2 at a flow rate of 2.88 mL min−1 and O2 at a flow rate of 4.12 mL min−1 are introduced into the system for the reaction. Meanwhile, N2 flows directly into the H2O2 collection vessel at a rate of 10 mL min−1, serving as a protective gas. The flow rate of the tail gas was measured using a precision molding flowmeter, and the concentrations of H2 and O2 in the tail gas were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC- 7820). A Teflon tube served as the connecting conduit, and the reaction occurred under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. The concentration of H2O2 in the reaction medium was determined by iodometric titration. Using this data, the H2 conversion (%), H2O2 selectivity (%), and H2O2 yield (g kgcat −1 h−1) of the catalyst were calculated according to eqs 1, 2, and 3.

However, the reaction must be conducted under a high pressure ranging from 2 to 3 MPa, which imposes stricter demands on the material selection for the microreactor. Kanungo et al. immobilized Au Pd nanoparticles on the inner wall of the channel within the microreactor for DSHP, enabling the synthesis of H2O2 at a concentration of 1.8 wt %.35 Since the catalyst is immobilized on the inner wall of the channel in the microreactor, its deactivation necessitates replacing the entire microreactor, which incurs prohibitively high costs. Yang et al. designed a microreactor for the synthesis of H2O2 at a concentration of 0.388 wt % under normal pressure. The continuous flow operation minimized the contact time between H2O2 and the catalyst, thereby reducing the decomposition of H2O2 induced by the catalyst. Consequently, the produced H2O2 could be utilized directly without further processing.36 However, the concentration of H2O2 generated remains relatively low. Therefore, it is essential to develop microreactors capable of continuously producing high-concentration H2O2 under normal temperature and pressure conditions, thereby enabling low-cost, on-site production and facilitating the industrial implementation of DSHP. In summary, this paper describes the independent design and fabrication of a microreactor for use as a DSHP reactor, utilizing LA-functionalized Pd−Ni catalyst and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as key materials. The impact of Ni doped and LA-functionalized Pd catalysts on the selectivity, yield, and concentration of H2O2 was investigated through experimental methods, DFT calculations, and comprehensive studies. The conclusions of this study offer valuable insights and serve as a reference for the future design and development of catalysts and microreactors. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Hydrogenation and decomposition experiments of the catalysts were conducted in the aforementioned microreactor using the same reaction medium, supplemented with 200.0 μL of a 30.0 wt % H2O2 solution. Hydrogenation experiments were conducted under H2 and N2 atmospheres with flow rates of 2.88 mL min−1 and 10.0 mL min−1, respectively. For the decomposition experiment, only N2 (10.0 mL min−1) was injected. The H2O2 hydrogenation or decomposition rate of the catalyst (g kgcat −1 h−1) was calculated by eq 4.
