For the continuous-flow experiments, the experimental setup (Figure 1) consisted of two syringe pumps (Holmarc Optomechatronics, India) loaded with stainless steel syringes (SS316 syringe, 50 mL volume), one containing nitric acid and the other containing o-xylene, connected to SS316 tubes (1/8 in. o.d.). The outlets of the pumps were connected to an AmAr1 micromixer (Figure 1) followed by a resid

2 for nitration is relatively higher than that of 3. Furthermore, isomer 3 was found to have a greater tendency to yield oxidative products, although the rates of these oxidation reactions were relatively lower than those of nitration. In order to see the eﬀect of dispersion and the nature of the flow (with 3 mol of FNA and 1 mol each of water and 2, it becomes a two-phase flow), experi- ments in 

Summary: The paragraph discusses the continuous-flow synthesis of aromatic nitro compounds using microreactors for selectivity-sensitive reactions like aromatic nitration. A specific example is given with o-xylene as the starting material and nitric acid as the nitrating agent in a tubular reactor, producing mononitroxylenes (1,2-dimethyl-3-nitrobenzene and 1,2-dimethyl-4-nitrobenzene) and dinitro derivatives depending on experimental conditions. The reduction of 1,2-dimethyl-4-nitrobenzene yields xylidine, which has applications in various fields.

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for continuous nitration of o-xylene using nitric acid as the nitrating agent. The reaction is carried out in a tubular reactor with a residence time of 10 minutes at atmospheric pressure and temperature between 50-80°C. Key reactants include o-xylene, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid (as catalyst). Products are ortho-, meta-, and para-nitrophenol isomers. The reactor type is a microreactor with an internal diameter of 1 mm. Conversion and yield data for the process have been obtained, but selectivity information is not mentioned in this paragraph.

adequate heat transfer coeﬃcient is achieved by providing the necessary heat transfer area as well as the Nusselt number on the tube as well as the shell side. Thus, it is always possible to design a flow reactor that can take care of location-specific heat duties as the reaction proceeds along the length of reactor. In the present exercise, it was assumed that for a fixed capacity and for a given

Flow-chemistry process development: Reaction type - nitration of o-xylene with a mixture of concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 as the nitrating agents. Key reactants - o-xylene, nitric acid, sulfuric acid (solvent). Catalyst - none mentioned. Products - dinitro and mononitro derivatives of o-xylene. Reactor details - not specified in this context. Critical conditions - flow rate(s), residence time, temperature, pressure are not given for the nitration process. Outcomes - conversion, yield, selectivity depend on reaction type, heat generation rates, and overall heat transfer coefficient; a reactor with tubes of different sizes can achieve better heat transfer depending on local heat generation rates. 

Note: The summary focuses only on flow-chemistry process development aspects mentioned in the given context.

The samples were analyzed using gas chromatography with an HP5 capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID). Dinitro impurities were identified using GC−MS.

Summary: The paragraph discusses the continuous-flow nitration of o-xylene using a jacketed tubular reactor with mixed acid as the nitrating agent. The key reactants are o-xylene and the nitrating mixture (HNO3:H2SO4). The desired product is dinitro derivatives, and the critical conditions include temperature (40 °C), residence time (10 min), and concentrations of mixed acid (4 molar equiv or more). The reactor type is a jacketed tubular reactor. The conversion and yield are affected by the nitrating agent's composition and concentration, with an optimal condition of 20 °C and less than 40 s residence time for maximum yield and minimum formation of undesired products. An economic feasibility analysis shows that running multiple parallel reactors is advantageous for high production capacity (100 or 500 kg/h).
