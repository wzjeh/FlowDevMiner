all raw material solutions): 12.5 mol of NADA was added to a 50 L stirring kettle, followed by water to the 25 L mark, and the mixture was stirred until dissolved. Finally, impurities were removed by filtration, and the concentration was determined via diazotization titration. 2.5. Experimental Procedure for Continuous Process. Details of the continuous flow experimental setup are provided in the Supporting Information section. The continuous flow synthesis process of C.I. Reactive Red 195 is illustrated in Figure 2. Before the reaction, the mechanical stirrer is activated first to ensure proper mixing of the reactants. The reaction temperature is then controlled by a high−low temperature circulating chiller to maintain the desired temperature throughout the process. The flow rates and start times of the pumps are controlled by a PLC control panel. Based on the preset start times, the pumps delivering NADA, hydrochloric acid, and sodium nitrite solutions are activated simultaneously to transport the three raw materials to the bottom of the tubular reactor. The raw materials flow upward through the reactor and undergo diazotization in the corresponding zone, producing diazonium salts. When the reactant mixture reaches "Inlet 4", the pump delivering a sulfamic acid solution is activated, directing it to the oxidation−reduction zone of the reactor, where excess nitrite is eliminated. Upon reaching "Inlet 5", the pump delivering the CTN solution is activated, transporting the solution to the coupling zone, where it mixes with diazonium salts and undergoes a coupling reaction to form the target dye. The product is then discharged from the top of the reactor into the storage tank for a 5 min delayed reaction to ensure complete conversion. Finally, the liquid dye is dried into powder by the spray dryer for subsequent processing and analysis. The dye purity is analyzed by HPLC at a wavelength of 254 nm using the peak area normalization method. 2.6. Dyeing Process. Cotton fibers were dyed using both the dyes synthesized in this study and commercial C.I. Reactive Red 195. The procedure was as follows: First, 2 g of cotton fibers and 0.04 g of C.I. Reactive Red 195 were added to a 40 mL aqueous solution. Subsequently, the samples were placed in an ECO DYER and dyed at room temperature for 30 min, with 2 g of sodium sulfate added every 15 min. The

(XS) decreases, indicating better mixing performance. The minimum XS value is approximately 0.03, close to zero, indicating that the reactor provides nearly ideal mixing conditions, ensuring uniform distribution of reactants. Whether 1-naphthol is fed through Inlet 4 or Inlet 5, the mixing efficiency remains stable. This demonstrates that the material can be efficiently mixed regardless of the inlet used. Considering both energy consumption and reaction efficiency, a rotation speed of 100 rpm was selected as the optimal condition for the subsequent continuous synthesis of C.I. Reactive Red 195. 3.2. Optimization of Continuous Flow Reaction Conditions. In the multistep continuous flow synthesis of C.I. Reactive Red 195, the diazotization and coupling reactions are critical steps.44 Transitioning from batch production to continuous-flow processes requires comprehensive optimiza- tion of key reaction parameters, which focus primarily on the

process remains absent, which is essential for improving the C.I. Reactive Red 195 production and ensuring safety. Unlike traditional batch operations, continuous flow technology offers several advantages, including high mass and heat transfer efficiency, stable product quality, and a compact footprint.22−24 Recently, researchers have conducted continu- ous coupling reactions in a microreactor, using preprepared diazonium salts and coupling components, to synthesize water- insoluble azo dyes or pigments, such as Pigment Yellow 12,25,26

also known as the Diazo coupling reaction, has been widely used to characterize the mixing efficiency of various reactors.32−34 The specific reaction formula and details can be found in the Supporting Information. In this study, the reaction system was employed to assess the mixing efficiency in a dynamic tubular reactor, with the segregation index (XS) determined based on product concentration measurements. 2.4.

3.1. Characterization of Mixing. The mixing perform- ance of the reactor is critical to the reaction outcome,43 as it directly impacts both the efficiency and selectivity. To evaluate the mixing efficiency, a competitive consecutive reaction system (Bourne reaction) was employed. As shown in Figure 3, with an increase in rotation speed, the segregation index

solvent's boiling point due to the open nature of the reaction system. TD0.05 represents the process temperature correspond- ing to TMRad of 0.05 h. With continuous flow, the residence time of the material in the dynamic tubular reactor does not exceed 0.05 h, indicating that uncontrolled reactions are unlikely to reach the maximum reaction rate at lower temperatures and shorter residence times. Therefore, TD0.05 is used instead of TD24 as the critical parameter for the safety assessment of the continuous diazotization process. The critical level for the NADA continuous diazotization process is determined to be level 1 based on (TP < MTSR < MTT < TD0.05), indicating low risk.
