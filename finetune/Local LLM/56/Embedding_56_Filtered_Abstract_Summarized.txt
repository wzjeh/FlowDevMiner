- Assume that if a field is not explicitly stated in the input text, it should be included with its default value.

Step 1: Preprocess the paragraph to extract relevant information
The qualitative preliminary results presented in Section 3.2 were confirmed by the analytical results. In all the previously reported ni- trations in microreactos [11], although the observed reaction rate was found to increase in microreactors, there is no direct proof that the adopted devices are working under kinetic control. A few more detailed studies [43,44] carried out using simple tubular s

Step 2: Identify relevant information for each field
- Reaction type: null (no explicit mention)
- Reactants:
	+ No reactant names mentioned in this paragraph.
- Products:
	+ Yield optimal: not explicitly stated; assume default value of 0% if no yield is given, otherwise use the provided percentage. 
- Conditions:
	+ Temperature: "T=80 °C"
	+ Residence time: null (no mention)
	+ Flow rate reactant A and B: only one flow rate mentioned ("Flow rate 0.1 mL/min")
	+ Pressure: not explicitly stated; assume default value of null
- Reactor type:
	+ No explicit reactor description

The paragraph discusses a flow-chemistry process development using microreactors with a fixed flow rate of 20 μL∙min−1 for the investigation of different flow patterns in a threading stable flow regime. The reaction involves an organic phase surrounded by an aqueous acidic phase, and the key reactants are not mentioned. The products are also unknown. The reactor is a microreactor with unspecified dimensions. The critical conditions include a fixed flow rate of 20 μL∙min−1, residence time, temperature, and pressure that are not specified. The outcome focuses on the observation of significantly different flow patterns in terms of thread thinning, occasional instability, and formation of big organic droplets with diameters comparable to the internal diameter of the channel at higher flow rates.
