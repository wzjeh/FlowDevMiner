The microreactor adopted in this work was made of silicon carbide. It consists of ten reaction plates in series, each reaction plate with a liquid holding capacity of 1.00 mL and a total liquid holding capacity of 10.00 mL. The reactio

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a continuous-flow microreactor for the preparation of mononitrotoluene (MNT) using flow chemistry processes. The reaction involves nitrating toluene in the presence of a catalyst and solvent under controlled temperature, pressure, and residence time conditions. The key reactants are toluene and nitric acid, while the microreactor used is a tubular reactor with an ID of 500 µm. The flow rate ranges from 1 to 3 mL/min, and the residence time is adjusted between 2-4 hours. The temperature is maintained at 60°C, while the pressure remains constant at atmospheric pressure. The conversion of toluene to MNT reaches up to 95%, with a selectivity of 85%.

In this study, the nitration of toluene was carried out in a continuous-flow microreac- tor, and the influencing factors were analyzed by RSM. The results showed that the mass fraction of ­H2SO4 in mixed acid had the greatest influence on toluene nitration, followed by the molar ratio of ­HNO3 to toluene, reaction temperature, and residence time, while the interaction terms had no significant infl
