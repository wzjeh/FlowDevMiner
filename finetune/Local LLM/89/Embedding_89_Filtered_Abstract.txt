The accurate control of residence time can be achieved by means of a continuous microflow system.19 For liquid–liquid heterogeneous and fast reactions, the reaction rate may be hindered by mass transfer resistance between phases.

The schematic overview of the homogeneous continuous microflow system is shown in Fig. 1. The homogeneous solution was prepared by dissolving 2-MNT (0.5 g) in H2SO4 with a specific mass fraction (160 g) and stirring for 12 h. The mixed acid was prepared by dissolving a specific concentration of HNO3 in the same mass and mass fraction of H2SO4 solution. The homogeneous solution and the mixed acid w

where t is the reaction residence time and V is the volume of the microchannel. Qh and Qm are the volume flow rates of the homogeneous solution and mixed acid, respectively.

Therefore, it is reliable that accurate nitration kinetic parameters can be obtained by a homogeneous nitration reaction in a continuous microflow system. However, accurate 2-MNT nitration kinetics has not been reported so far. In this work, a homogeneously continuous microflow system has been constructed to determine the kinetics of 2-MNT nitration. The accurate control of temperature and residen

Flow-chemistry process development: Aromatic nitration using phenol as the key reactant with a solvent of acetonitrile or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a catalyst of concentrated HNO3 in microreactors. The reaction produces nitrophenols, trinitrophenols, and other nitroaromatic compounds as products. Reactor details: Microreactors with excellent mass and heat transfer performance, rapid mixing rate, and uniform distribution of concentration. Critical conditions: Flow rates vary depending on the desired product conversion/yield/selectivity; residence time is short due to fast reactions (minutes); temperature control is essential for exothermic reactions (60-80°C). Outcomes: Conversion, yield, and selectivity of nitroaromatic compounds can be improved using microreactors compared to traditional reactors.

shown in Fig. 13. 92% H2SO4 was selected and the conversion of 2-MNT was investigated at different temperatures. It can be observed that the calculated data fit well with the experimental data under both the conditions of a short residence time and a long residence time. The validity of the model can be confirmed. Therefore, it is credible to predict the reaction performance under different reacti

In this work, the mass transfer resistance between two liquid phases in the heterogeneous reaction process was completely eliminated by constructing a homogeneous system. And the kinetics of 2-MNT homogeneous nitration were investigated with a continuous microflow. The effects of temperature, molar ratio, residence time, and H2SO4 mass fraction on the conversion of 2-MNT and selectivity to DNT wer
