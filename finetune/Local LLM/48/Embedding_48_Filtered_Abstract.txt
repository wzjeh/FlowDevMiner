Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process using an optically transparent AHPCS derived microchannel for photocatalytic microreaction applications. The reaction type is decomposition photochemistry and sterilization effect on E. coli. Key reactants are not mentioned, but it is implied that the broth containing E. coli was used as a starting material. There is no mention of solvent or catalyst. The products are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the decomposition of photochemical components in the broth led to some form of product formation. The reactor details include an AHPCS derived microchannel with excellent stability and high optical transparency. Critical conditions mentioned are flow rate (same as control group), residence time, temperature, and pressure, which were not explicitly stated but can be assumed to be similar to conventional microreactors.
