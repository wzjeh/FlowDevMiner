It is even possible to fit these data to a linear function with a correlation coefficient of R2 ) 0.98 and a slope of approximately 0.08/1000 (µL/min). Clearly, this is due to the high degree of interaction between the pa

A continuous flow microreactor was used for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (5 to 50 nm) directly from a gold salt (HAuCl4) and a reducing agent (ascorbic acid). Experimental parameters were optimized to obtain narrow size distributions, which were at average two times narrower than those obtained in a conventional synthesis. Additionally, two approaches, i.e., elevation of pH during reaction

Solely at a total flow of 500 µL/min the half width of the size distribution is considerably lower: 31% (corresponding to σ ) 13%) compared to all other flow rates (Figure 4), a result we cannot explain conclusively, yet. Figure 5 shows the correlation between concentration ratio (reducing agent/gold ions) and the result

Summary: The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process development for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles using a native reactor with a pH of 2.8, 1 mM HAuCl4 as reactants, 20 mM ascorbic acid as reducing agent, and 0.025% PVP as stabilizing agent. The total flow rate is 2000 µL/min. The reaction results in the formation of gold nanoparticles with varying sizes depending on the concentration of PVP used.

Unfortunately most standard syntheses yield particles with rather broad size distributions, and thus microreactors are suggested for these syntheses because simply scaling down the reaction volume was often sufficient to lower the polydispersity of the particle samples.24 One reason might be efficient and homogeneous mixing in microreactors, which is superior to the heterogeneous flow and mixing c
