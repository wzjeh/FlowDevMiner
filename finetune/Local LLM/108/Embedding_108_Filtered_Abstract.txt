Summary: The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process development for the conversion of BY28 using a PI/H2O2 system in a microreactor with varying dye–PI inlet flow rates (Qdye = 278–1100 µL/s, Cdye,in = 25 µM and [PI]in = 1 mM) at pHin 5. The reactor length is L = 2 m. The critical conditions include the flow rate(s), residence time, temperature, pressure, which are not mentioned in the paragraph.

Summary: The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process development for the conversion of BY28 using the PI/H2O2 system in a microreactor with varying H2O2 flow rates and initial PI concentrations (Qdye = 565 µL/s, Cdye,in = 25 µM, [PI]in = 0.5–2 mM, pHin 5, reactor length L = 2 m). The reaction type is not mentioned explicitly; key reactants are BY28 and H2O2 with PI as a catalyst (or possibly an additional reactant), and the product is not specified. Critical conditions include varying H2O2 flow rates and initial PI concentrations, while temperature and pressure remain constant at 5°C and atmospheric pressure, respectively. The outcome of this study is the conversion of BY28 as a function of H2O2 flow rate at different initial PI inlet concentrations.

Summary: The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process development using the PI/H2O2 system in a microreactor for TOC conversion. Key reactants are PI and H2O2; dye BY28 is also mentioned as an indicator of reaction progress. The reactor type is not specified, but it has a length of 2 m and operates at 25°C. The critical conditions include varying flow rates for both H2O2 and dye (BY28), with two PI inlet concentrations (1 and 2 mM) and constant [H2O2]0 = 50 mM, pH inlet = 5. The outcomes are not mentioned explicitly but may include conversion, yield, or selectivity based on the reaction type (TOC conversion).

Summary: The paragraph describes a flow-chemistry process development for the conversion of BY28 by PI/H2O2 system in a microreactor. The reaction type is not mentioned explicitly but it seems to be a degradation or oxidation process based on the use of H2O2 as an oxidant and PI as a catalyst. Key reactants are BY28, H2O2, and PI; solvent is water. The product is not specified. Reactor details include a flowing microreactor with a length of 2 m and the use of Cdye,in = 25 µM and [PI]in = 1 mM at pH 5. Critical conditions are H2O2 flow rate (Qdye = 565 µL/s) and reactor length L = 2 m. The outcome is the impact of different water matrices on BY28 conversion by PI/H2O2 system in the microreactor, which suggests that this process has been optimized for a specific flow rate and residence time.
