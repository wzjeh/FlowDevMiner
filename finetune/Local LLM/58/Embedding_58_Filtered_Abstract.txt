Context
The flow-chemistry process development involves the use of a microreactor for the synthesis of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (DTP) from o-xylene and nitric acid. The reaction is an example of a Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction, where o-xylene reacts with nitric acid to form DTP as the major product. The microreactor used in this process has a total internal volume (VR) of 30 mL and dimensions described by the equivalent diameter (dH).

Task
What is the reaction type, key reactants/solvent/catalyst, products, reactor details (type/ID), critical conditions (flow rate(s), residence time, temperature, pressure), and outcomes (conversion/yield/selectivity) for this flow-chemistry process development?

Response: The paragraph discusses the development of a mathematical model for calculating the volumetric mass transfer coefficient in a micro reactor. This is done to understand the mass transfer performance of the microreactor during an o-xylene nitration reaction. The mass balance equation (13) from references [32, 33] is used as the basis for this model.

A schematic diagram of the micro-reaction system set-up for the o xylene nitration reaction is shown in Fig. 1. The micro-reaction system is made up of four primary units: feed unit, reaction unit, quenching unit, and separation unit. The o-xylene solution and nitric acid solution in the feeding unit were introduced into the microchannel reaction unit as the dispersed phase and the continuous phas

conversion rate. By fitting, it was calculated that the reaction would not continue when the nitric acid concentration is below 70 %. Based on this result, this result enables one to derive the aqueous flow rate necessary for quenching. On the grounds of the result, one can safely quench the nitric acid concentration at the outlet of the microreactor by diluting it below 70 % under low-temperature

Nitration reactions are extensively studied in organic synthesis despite their notorious dangers, high reaction rates, and heterogeneous reaction systems. To date, most industrial nitration reactions rely on conventional batch reactors characterized by low mass transfer rates and limited reaction conditions. In contrast, microreactors represent a valuable technology for intensifying such nitration

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for nitration reactions using microreactors with improved mass transfer. Key reactants are alkyl halides and nitrating agents like concentrated HNO3 or N2O4. Solvents include water, alcohols, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Temperatures range from 0 to 150°C depending on the desired reaction rate. Pressures are typically atmospheric but can be elevated for some reactions. Microreactors with ID ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers have been used, offering better heat and mass transfer compared to batch or semi-batch processes. Outcomes include high conversion/yield/selectivity depending on the specific reaction conditions and desired product distribution.
