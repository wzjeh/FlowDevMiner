Using a microreactor, we were able to gently control the flow rate of the two joined phases with electrical syringe pumps. Change in flow rate

min. This is because as the flow rate increases, apigenin is able to mix more quickly into deionized water. Due to the short time allowed for crystal growth, apigenin crystallizes quickly, and it is easier to form nanocrystals with small particle size and narrow particle size distribu­ tion [52]. The effects of different flow rates on the mixing index and effective time of apigenin can be compared

[18,19]. However, the traditional preparation methods are usually performed at macroscale. At the macroscale, it is difficult to accurately control the preparation environment of nano drug crystals and easily leads to wide particle size distribution. Microreactor technology has been widely used for the preparation of microscale and nanoscale particles [20–23]. Compared with traditional methods, mi

effect (Fig. 9(b)). When Q = 1 mL/min, t0.9 is only 0.16 s. It can be judged that the larger the flow, the shorter the effective time required in the apigenin molecular molecule reactor, and the better the mass transfer effect.

where u denotes the velocity vector, ρ is the fluid density, p is the pressure, μ is the viscosity, Cap is the mass fraction of apigenin and D is the diffusion coefficient of the apigenin molecule. CFD software, ANSYS/FLUENT 19.2, was used to solve the governing equations. In the experiment, the flow state of solvent and anti-solvent was laminar flow, thus the laminar flow model was adopted.
