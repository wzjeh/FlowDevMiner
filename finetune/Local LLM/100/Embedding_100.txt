The platforms of continuous nitration are illustrated in Fig. 1. On feed was the mixed acid of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. The other feed was 1 or the mixture of 1 and 2. Both of them were pumped into the preheating tube (ID, 0.80 mm; OD, 1.60 mm; 316 L) by two constant flux pumps (Beijing Xingda Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd.; flow rate, 0–30.00 mL/min; pressure range, 0–20 MPa), respective- ly. These two streams mixed in the T-type micromixer (ID, 0.25 mm; SS316L; Valco Instruments Co. Inc.), and then passed through the reaction tubes switched by the switch valve. The reaction tubes had three types: a thin tube (ID, 0.75 mm; OD, 1.60 mm; ETFE), a thick tube (ID, 4 mm; OD, 6 mm; 316 L), and a micropacked-bed reactor (ID, 4 mm; OD, 6 mm; 316 L; filled with glass beads; PTFE mesh (0.150 mm) set at both ends to fix the glass beads). Three kinds of glass beads (ASONE Co.) were used in with the micropacked-bed reactor, of which the size was 0.177– 0.250 mm, 0.350–0.500 mm, and 0.500–0.710 mm, respec- tively. Correspondingly, the void fraction was determined to be 34%, 38%, and 40%, respectively. The packing density was kept at about 1.5–1.6 g/cm3. The length of reaction tubes adjusted according to the required residence time; the reaction tubes were placed vertically, and the fluid flowed from top to bottom. The connecting tube between the micromixer and the reaction tubes was 5 cm in length and 0.75 mm in ID. After a certain residence time, the effluent was collected by a sample bottle with ice water to quench the reaction. For the isothermal nitration, preheating tubes, the T-type micromixer, and reaction tubes were placed in a water bath (± 0.5 °C; ZNCL-GS-CX30; Henan Aibote Technology Development Co. Ltd.), as shown in Fig. 1a. And for the adiabatic nitration, preheating tubes were placed in a water bath; the T-type micromixer, connecting tube, and reaction tubes were wrapped by multiple layers of thermal insulation cotton (including the materials with very low thermal conduc- tivity, such as the glass fiber, the aluminum silicate fiber, the rubber-plastic sponge) to provide a nearly adiabatic

the micropacked-bed reactor, the T-type micromixer had lim- ited influence on the reaction conversion, and the reaction is mainly completed in the micropacked-bed. As shown in Fig. 4d, the smaller the packing particles are, the sooner a complete conversion platform appeared. To achieve 90% conversion, it took about 1 s for smaller packing size (0.177–0.250 mm) and about 3 s for larger packing size (0.350–0.500 mm). But smaller particles corresponded to higher pressure drop (more details can be found in Supplementary Information). Therefore, it requires to make a compromise between the mixing performance and the system pressure drop. Overall, through the optimization of the reaction conditions and system configuration, the nitration of 1 could proceed sufficiently within the residence time of 5 s by using an adia- batic micropacked-bed reactor. The partial product circulation could control the adiabatic reaction temperature reliably and flexibly, assuring the selectivity not less than 89%. We sum- marized different operation processes for comparisons, as shown in Table S2. The intensification strategy with the com- bination of a micropacked-bed reactor and a partial product circulation took distinct advantages in productivity, safety, and controllability (more details can be found in Table S3, Supplementary Information).

tube, due to its small inner diameter, the initial dispersion was relatively good, but the phase separation in sequence could not be avoided (as shown in Fig. S3(a)), corresponding to a quick- ly decreased conversion rate. In contrast, the micropacked-bed reactor can enable and keep a microdispersion state through- out the system. As shown in Fig. S3(b), well-dispersed organ- ic phase droplets can be obtained at the end of the micropacked-bed reactor. Even at low flow rates (1 mL/min of organic phase flow rate), the micropacked-bed reactor can still achieve effective two-phase dispersion. This difference between the liquid-liquid two-phase reaction in the micropacked-bed reactor and the thin tube was similar to what Kappe et al. [10] reported in the generation of dichlorocarbene utilizing the classical biphasic reaction of aqueous sodium hydroxide and chloroform system. Therefore, the reaction was complete in short residence time, and the reaction effi- ciency was greatly improved. Figure 4c and d show the effects of the system configura- tion on the adiabatic nitration reaction. As we know, the micromixer mainly provides an initial two-phase dispersion. A suddenly expanded connecting tube after a T-type micromixer was beneficial to provide instantaneous and rapid mixing [13]. However, as seen from Fig. 4c, compared with

where ΔHm is reaction heat; cp is the heat capacity of the fluid; m is the mass flow rate of the substance; ΔT is the reaction temperature rise; n1 is the molar flow rate of 1. We further assumed that the reaction was irreversible, the reaction system was completely insulated; and the density, heat capacity, and enthalpy did not change during the reaction proceeding. The relationship between conversion X and tem- perature rise ΔT can be described as:
