paragraph = """
The paragraph discusses the development of a continuous-flow microreactor system 
for the Gattermann reaction synthesis of 2,4,5-trifluorobromobenzene from 
2,4,5-trifluoroaniline with HBr and NaNO2. The reactor type is T-micromixer based 
microchannel reactors. Key reactants are 2,4,5-trifluoroaniline, HBr, and NaNO2; 
solvent/catalyst details are not mentioned. Products include the desired product (2,4,5-
trifluorobromobenzene) along with undesired byproducts due to uncontrolled thermal decomposition in batch reactors.
Reactor details: T-micromixer based microchannel reactors. Critical conditions: 
flow rates and residence times are not mentioned; temperature and pressure are controlled for the exothermic diazotization reaction using continuous-flow microreactors.
Outcomes: The use of continuous-flow microreactors facilitates the Gattermann reaction, offering advantages such as efficient heat and mass transfer, high safety, good reproducibility, and easy scale-up compared to traditional batch reactors."""
