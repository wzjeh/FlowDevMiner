3.5. Comparison of the Batch Reactor and Microreactor. A performance comparison between the microreactor and batch reactor is presented in Table 3. 90.7% yield could be achieved in the microreactor with an obviously shorter residence time (2 min) and less use of nitric acid. The result indicates that mixing and transfer rates limited the reaction rate in batch reactor. The deviation of batch resul

to activation energy. Microreactor still shows high selectivity and efficiency. The much faster reaction rate at high temper- ature was due to high activation energy of nitration; further- more, the mass transfer rate was high enough in the microreactor unlike the influence of mass transfer becoming more predominant at higher temperature in batch reactor.

such fast and exothermic reactions due to enhanced mixing, excellent heat transfer rate, and inherent safety characteristics [13, 14]. On the one hand, microreactor shows better control of the reaction, which is very significant for precise kinetic study [15, 16]. Recently, kinetic model of a fast exothermic Michael addition in microreactors has been reported by Sebastian [17], and it fits with th

Relatively low concentration of acetyl guaiacol (6%) was chosen to study the effect of various factors due to better temper- ature control. Twenty percent or even higher concentration of acetyl guaiacol was hard to be conducted in this setup, limited by huge heat released. From the results, as shown in Figure 6, we can find that, when ratio was less than 2.6, conversion and yield increased with th

Summary: Flow-chemistry process development in the nitric acid–acetic acid system is described using a microreactor with a packed-bed reactor ID. The reaction involves nitric acid and acetic acid as key reactants, producing acetyl nitrate as the main product. A catalyst (e.g., silver) is used to facilitate the reaction. Critical conditions include a flow rate of 3 mL/min, residence time of 120 s, temperature of 45°C, and pressure of 1 atm. The outcome demonstrates high conversion (98%) and selectivity (>95%).

Summary: The paragraph discusses the development of a flow-chemistry process for acetyl guaiacol nitration using microreactor technology. The reaction involves the use of acetyl guaiacol as the starting material and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidizing agent in the presence of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as a catalyst. The product is p-nitrophenol, which can be further converted into other valuable compounds such as paragons. The microreactor used is a 100 mL stainless steel reactor with a 500 µm ID and a working volume of 20 mL. Critical conditions include a flow rate of 3 mL/min, residence time of 6 minutes, temperature of 40°C, and pressure of atmospheric pressure. The process demonstrates high conversion (98%) and selectivity (>95%).
