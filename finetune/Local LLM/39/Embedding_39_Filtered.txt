In recent years, microchannel reactor technology has demonstrated considerable potential in chemical synthesis. Compared to conventional batch reactors [21,22], continuous-flow microchannel reactors offer distinct advantages, including a high surface area-to-volume ratio,

Fig. 1. Fig. caption. (a) The continuous-flow microchannel reactor consists of three independent components: the microreactor, the LED illumination module, and the heating module.(b) The microreactor is composed of five modules, including a premixing module.(c) The mixing and reaction module is a coil-type reactor.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the continuous-flow microreactor system comprises three core subsystems: a modular microreactor assembly, an LED illumination unit, and a temperature control module (Fig. 1(a)).The microreactor assembly integrates five functional segments: a premixing module (Fig. 1(b)) followed by four coiled FEP reaction modules (Fig. 1 (c)). Each reaction module has a coil configuration with 45 m length and dimensional parameters of 3 mm OD (outer diameter) / 2 mm ID (inner diameter).The LED unit employs uniformly distributed matrix arrays on bilateral sides to ensure homogeneous irradiance. The temperature control system incorporates integrated heating/cooling elements for precise thermal uniformity.

As depicted in Fig. 2, Solution A was preheated to 70◦C via a ther­ mostatted plunger pump and fed into the reaction system. Simulta­ neously, Gas B (Cl₂) was delivered from a high-pressure cylinder regulated by a pressure-reducing valve and mass flow controller. The two streams underwent premixing before entering the microchannel reactor. Reaction progression occurred under controlled temperature and pressure. Upon completion, the effluent was collected at the reactor outlet. Unreacted Cl₂ and byproduct HCl were scrubbed with 2M NaOH solution. System pressure was maintained using a back-pressure valve positioned downstream. Reaction products and byproducts were char­ acterized by ¹H-NMR, ¹³C-NMR, and GC-MS analyses.

millimeter-scale channels to establish plug flow with minimal back mixing, enabling efficient thermal management and precise regulation of reaction conditions.

The implementation of a microchannel reactor facilitates precise control of reaction feedstocks within a confined space, ensuring reaction accuracy while preventing back-mixing. Furthermore, the system effi­ ciently dissipates excess process heat, establishing stable external con­ ditions that enhance product purity while significantly improving target product yield and selectivity. This approach not only accelerates chlo­ rination kinetics but also partially mitigates safety concerns associated with liquid chlorine.

The sharp increase in EC conversion at 12.5 min may be attributed to homogeneous gas-liquid mixing within the microchannel reactor, which forms a gas-in-liquid dispersion favorable for interfacial reactions. In contrast, the significant decline in EC conversion at residence times beyond 25 min is likely due to the transition to a liquid-in-gas disper­ sion, where uneven mixing reduces mass transfer efficiency. Therefore,

enhanced heat and mass transfer efficiency, operational flexibility, enhanced safety, and minimal by-product formation. These features enable precise control of reaction conditions, leading to high selectivity and simplified scalability. Consequently, continuous-flow microchannel reactors have found broad application in photocatalytic chemistry, encompassing photocatalytic halogenation of benzyl compounds [11, 12,23], photocatalytic oxidation [24], photocatalytic diazotization [25], cyclopropanation of heteroaryl and aryl diazo compounds [26], and addition reactions of heteroaromatic compounds [27].In the domain of C-H chlorination, researchers including Ilhyong Ryu et al. [6, 28,29] and Jiquan Zhao et al. [12,30] have achieved selective C-H chlorination of alkanes, arenes, and carbonates using microchannel re­ actors, yielding encouraging outcomes. Klaus J¨ahnisch et al. [31] has also reported successful photochemical chlorination in continuous-flow microreactors.

In microchannel reactor systems, the residence time of reactants is another critical factor influencing the reaction, as it indirectly de­ termines the effective duration of light exposure during the photo­ catalytic process. The effect of residence time on the reaction was investigated at 85◦C and an EC:Cl₂ molar ratio of 1:0.48. As shown in Fig. 5, EC conversion initially increased with residence time, rising sharply at 12.5 min before peaking at 38.9% at 18.5 min. Beyond this residence time, conversion gradually declined, with a significant drop observed at 25 min.
